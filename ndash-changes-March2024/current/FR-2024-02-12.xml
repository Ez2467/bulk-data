                <HD SOURCE="HD1">Background</HD>
                <P>The FAA has received a report of a missing nut and washer and of a migrated bolt in the aft rudder quadrant, which were discovered by an operator during a scheduled routine inspection in mid-December 2023. Boeing subsequently inspected all Model 737–8, –8200, and –9 airplanes in production and found one additional under-torqued nut at the same location. It was discovered that the required run-on and final torques had not been applied to the nut in production.</P>
                <P>A disconnect between the aft rudder quadrant and the output rod (due to the bolt falling out) would result in loss of rudder control via the rudder pedals. Rudder surface position would then be based only on the rudder trim and yaw damper systems. The pilots would be able to slowly move the rudder surface by adjusting the rudder trim position but would be limited by the maximum rudder trim authority. In the event of a disconnect, and with the limited rudder trim authority, there would not be enough rudder control to counter an engine-out scenario during takeoff/climb out or to counter a high crosswind (above 20 kts) during landing. This condition, if not addressed, could result in the loss of continued safe flight and landing. The FAA is issuing this AD to address the unsafe condition on these products.</P>
                <HD SOURCE="HD1">FAA's Determination</HD>
                <P>The FAA is issuing this AD because the agency has determined the unsafe condition described previously is likely to exist or develop in other products of the same type design.</P>
                <HD SOURCE="HD1">Related Service Information</HD>
                <P>
                    The FAA reviewed Boeing Multi Operator Message MOM–MOM–23–0993–01B, dated December 27, 2023. The service information specifies 
                    <PRTPAGE P="9742"/>
                    performing a one-time detailed visual inspection or remote video inspection of the aft rudder quadrant for any missing bolt, nut, or washer; any gap between the bolt/nut/washer and quadrant; and insufficient thread protrusion. The service information also specifies the following corrective actions if necessary: inspection of the bolt and nut for damage and replacement as needed; torque application; and a rudder travel test.
                </P>
                <HD SOURCE="HD1">AD Requirements</HD>
                <P>This AD requires accomplishing the actions specified in the service information described previously.</P>
                <HD SOURCE="HD1">Justification for Immediate Adoption and Determination of the Effective Date</HD>
                <P>
                    Section 553(b)(3)(B) of the Administrative Procedure Act (APA) (5 U.S.C. 551 
                    <E T="03">et seq.</E>
                    ) authorizes agencies to dispense with notice and comment procedures for rules when the agency, for “good cause,” finds that those procedures are “impracticable, unnecessary, or contrary to the public interest.” Under this section, an agency, upon finding good cause, may issue a final rule without providing notice and seeking comment prior to issuance. Further, section 553(d) of the APA authorizes agencies to make rules effective in less than 30 days, upon a finding of good cause.
                </P>
                <P>An unsafe condition exists that requires the immediate adoption of this AD without providing an opportunity for public comments prior to adoption. The FAA has found that the risk to the flying public justifies forgoing notice and comment prior to adoption of this rule because a disconnect between the aft rudder quadrant and the output rod would result in loss of rudder control via the rudder pedals and insufficient rudder control to counter an engine-out scenario during takeoff/climb out or to counter a high crosswind during landing, which could result in the loss of continued safe flight and landing. The corrective actions required by this AD must be accomplished within 30 days. This compliance time is shorter than the time necessary for the public to comment and for publication of the final rule. Accordingly, notice and opportunity for prior public comment are impracticable and contrary to the public interest pursuant to 5 U.S.C. 553(b)(3)(B).</P>
                <P>In addition, the FAA finds that good cause exists pursuant to 5 U.S.C. 553(d) for making this amendment effective in less than 30 days, for the same reasons the FAA found good cause to forgo notice and comment.</P>
                <HD SOURCE="HD1">Regulatory Flexibility Act</HD>
                <P>The requirements of the Regulatory Flexibility Act (RFA) do not apply when an agency finds good cause pursuant to 5 U.S.C. 553 to adopt a rule without prior notice and comment. Because the FAA has determined that it has good cause to adopt this rule without notice and comment, RFA analysis is not required.</P>
                <HD SOURCE="HD1">Costs of Compliance</HD>

                <P>This final rule amends FDA's regulations to codify FDA's existing approach that former approved applications for biological products under the FD&amp;C Act that have been deemed, pursuant to the Biologics Price Competition and Innovation Act of 2009 (BPCI Act), to be licenses for the biological products under the PHS Act can continue to incorporate by reference DS/DSI/DP information contained in a DMF if such information was referenced at the time the application was deemed to be a license, in order to avoid the risk of unnecessary disruptions and potential drug shortages for these products. This final rule also amends the regulations to reflect FDA's longstanding practices regarding the referencing of information contained in master files by biologics license applications (BLAs). The final rule codifies FDA's practice and policy that INDs for products that would be subject to licensure under the PHS Act may incorporate by reference any information in a master file. The final rule also amends the regulations to address the use of master files for the constituent parts of combination products licensed under the PHS Act.</P>
                <HD SOURCE="HD2">B. Summary of the Major Provisions of the Final Rule</HD>
                <P>
                    Under this final rule, FDA is amending its regulations to address the use of master files by BLAs and INDs for products subject to licensure under the PHS Act. This final rule confirms that former approved applications for biological products in new drug applications (NDAs) under the FD&amp;C Act that have been deemed, pursuant to the BPCI Act, to be licenses for the biological products under the PHS Act may continue relying on DMFs for information on DS/DSI/DP if such information in a master file was relied on at the time the application was deemed to be a license under the PHS Act. For BLAs outside the scope of the circumstances described in the preceding sentence, the final rule also codifies FDA's existing practice that BLAs may not rely on a master file for DS/DSI/DP information but may rely on a master file for other kinds of information.
                    <SU>1</SU>
                    <FTREF/>
                     This final rule also codifies FDA's practice that an IND for a product that would be subject to licensure as a BLA may incorporate by reference any information, including DS/DSI/DP information, contained in a master file. This final rule also provides that, while BLAs under the PHS Act may not incorporate by reference DS/DSI/DP information contained in master files for biological product constituent parts of combination products, they may do so for non-biological product constituent parts.
                </P>

                    <P>
                        <SU>1</SU>
                         FDA notes that an applicant may seek guidance from the relevant review division at the Agency if the applicant is unsure whether information in a master file constitutes DS/DSI/DP information in the context of a particular BLA.
                    </P>
                </FTNT>
                <HD SOURCE="HD2">C. Legal Authority</HD>
                <P>This final rule amends FDA's regulations, as part of FDA's implementation of the BPCI Act, as amended by the Further Consolidated Appropriations Act, 2020 (FCA). FDA's authority for this rule also derives from the biological product licensing provisions of the PHS Act and the provisions of the FD&amp;C Act applicable to drugs; the FD&amp;C Act provisions are applicable to biological products under the PHS Act.</P>
                <HD SOURCE="HD2">D. Costs and Benefits</HD>
                <P>By allowing certain BLAs to continue referencing a DMF for DS/DSI/DP information, FDA avoids imposing a potential new regulatory burden. Affected entities will incur minimal costs to read and understand the rule. FDA estimates that over 10 years at a discount rate of 7 percent, the final rule will generate annualized net cost savings ranging from $0.40 million to $5.19 million with a primary estimate of $2.80 million; at a discount rate of 3 percent, the final rule will generate annualized net cost savings ranging from $0.37 million to $5.17 million with a primary estimate of $2.77 million.</P>

                     FDA announced its intention to amend its regulations to address the use of master files by BLAs. Section 7002(b)(1) of the BPCI Act revised section 351(i) of the PHS Act (42 U.S.C. 262(i)), in part, to amend the definition of a “biological product” to include a “protein (except any chemically synthesized polypeptide).” Section 605 of the FCA Act (Pub. L. 116–94) later amended this definition to remove the parenthetical “(except any chemically synthesized polypeptide).”

                     Also, section 7002(e)(4) of the BPCI Act provided that, on March 23, 2020, an approved application for a biological product under section 505 of the FD&amp;C Act (21 U.S.C. 355) “shall be deemed to be a license for the biological product under” section 351 of the PHS Act.

                <P>The preamble to the proposed rule described FDA's current regulatory framework and practices regarding the use of master files by BLAs and INDs. The proposed rule also described a mechanism to provide for continued use of DMFs referenced by deemed BLAs. The preamble to the proposed rule further noted that there are combination products approved in BLAs under the PHS Act and that the rationale described in the proposed rule for the Agency's proposed approach to BLAs also applied to the biological product constituent part(s) of such combination products. FDA sought comments on whether applications for combination products submitted in BLAs under the PHS Act should be permitted to incorporate by reference DS/DSI/DP information for any non-biological product constituent part (for example, the drug constituent part of an antibody-drug conjugate).</P>
                <P>In this final rule, FDA is finalizing the approach described in the proposed rule with several changes. Based on comments received, FDA is adding provisions codifying the use of master files by BLAs under the PHS Act for combination products. In addition, FDA is making nonsubstantive changes to the structure of the codified language to improve its readability.</P>

Several comments recommend revisions to, or disagree with, individual provisions in the proposed rule. Some comments address the use of master files for combination products in response to FDA's request for public comment in the preamble to the proposed rule.</P>

                    We are issuing this final rule under section 7002(e) of the BPCI Act, as amended by section 607 of the FCA Act. FDA's authority for this final rule also derives from the biological product licensing provisions of the PHS Act and the provisions of the FD&amp;C Act (21 U.S.C. 321, 
                    <E T="03">et seq.</E>
                    ) applicable to drugs. Under these provisions, FDA has the authority to issue regulations designed to ensure, among other things, that biological products are safe, pure, and potent and manufactured in accordance with current good manufacturing practice. FDA also has general authority to issue regulations for the efficient enforcement of the FD&amp;C Act under section 701 of the FD&amp;C Act, which is applicable to biological products pursuant to section 351(j) of the PHS Act.

                <P>We describe and respond to the comments in section V.B below. We have numbered each comment topic to help distinguish between the issues raised in the comments. We have grouped similar comments together under the same number, and, in some cases, we have separated different issues discussed in the same comment for purposes of our responses.

                <P>
                    In addition, FDA has restructured the codified language to address comments and for ease of reading. The paragraph numbers in the codified text and preamble of this final rule differ from those used in the proposed rule. Where applicable in this preamble, we identify the paragraphs as numbered in the proposed, as well as final, codified language. Although the codified language has been restructured for ease of reading into a new § 601.2(g), the separate paragraphs of this rule, applicable to certain deemed BLAs, to INDs for products that would be subject to licensure as a BLA, and to non-biological product constituent parts of combination products regulated under the PHS Act, each function independently to address specific circumstances and codify FDA's practices for those circumstances. In the event of a stay or invalidation of any paragraph of new § 601.2(g), those paragraphs that remain in effect would continue to function sensibly

                <HD SOURCE="HD3">1. Final § 601.2(g)(1) (Proposed § 601.2(g))</HD>
                <P>We proposed that an application for a biological product submitted to FDA for licensure under section 351 of the PHS Act, licensed under section 351 of the PHS Act, or, except as provided in proposed § 601.2(h), deemed to be licensed under section 351 of the PHS Act, may not incorporate by reference DS/DSI/DP information contained in a master file (see proposed § 601.2(g)). We also proposed that amendments and supplements to these applications may not incorporate by reference such information contained in a master file.</P>
                <P>
                    FDA received several comments addressing this aspect of the proposed rule, some of which agree with the need for the provision and with FDA's rationale, and some of which disagree. Some of the comments that disagree propose that FDA permit BLAs more generally to incorporate by reference information on DS/DSI/DP contained in master files or permit this on a case-by-case basis. A few comments suggest that BLAs should be permitted to incorporate certain kinds of DS/DSI/DP information by reference or that BLAs for certain products should be permitted to incorporate by reference DS/DSI/DP 
                    <PRTPAGE P="9746"/>
                    information. For the reasons described below, we are not changing our approach in finalizing this proposal. However, because the final regulation also addresses combination products licensed in BLAs, final § 601.2(g)(1) (as well as final § 601.2(g)(3)) includes references to such applications. In addition, because § 601.2(g)(1) applies to a BLA regardless of submission type (
                    <E T="03">e.g.,</E>
                     application for approval, licensed BLA, amendment, supplement), we have removed the reference to “amendments” and “supplements.”
                </P>
                <P>(Comment 1) FDA received three comments disagreeing with FDA's proposed approach and suggesting that FDA instead permit BLAs more generally to incorporate by reference DS/DSI/DP information contained in master files on a case-by-case basis. One of these comments asserts that FDA's proposal is inconsistent with applying a risk-based approach to regulatory review of applications, and, in support of a case-by-case approach, specifically suggests that FDA permit BLAs to incorporate by reference this information when it does not increase risk to the patient.</P>
                <P>(Response 1) FDA disagrees that its proposal is inconsistent with applying a risk-based approach and declines to revise its proposal to permit incorporation by reference of DS/DSI/DP information contained in a master file on a case-by-case basis.</P>
                <P>
                    FDA agrees that it is important to employ a science- and risk-based approach to its regulation of BLAs. Accordingly, FDA considers the establishment and function of a robust quality assurance program to be essential for evaluating, controlling, and mitigating product quality risks. The Agency has carefully considered the (generally) complex characteristics of most biological products and the risks to product quality inherent in the manufacture of these products. As stated in the preamble to the proposed rule, most biological products tend to have certain features (
                    <E T="03">e.g.,</E>
                     amino acid sequence, glycosylation, folding, cellular phenotype) essential to their intended effect and can be very sensitive to changes to the manufacturing process. In addition, biological products isolated from biological sources may be complex heterogeneous mixtures. As a result of such characteristics, the manufacture of most biological products carries increased potential risk to product quality. As a scientific matter, for biological products, the Agency considers it to be generally impractical for the applicant to confirm DS/DSI/DP quality characteristics without complete knowledge of, and control over, all aspects of the manufacturing process, including the manufacturing process for the DS/DSI/DP. Absent such knowledge and control, the applicant generally cannot operate a quality assurance program that independently identifies, assesses, and mitigates quality risks, which is critical to assuring the quality of a biological product.
                </P>
                <P>For biological products, FDA has found that the fragmentation of DS/DSI/DP information between a master file and a BLA results in a risk to quality that is very difficult to mitigate. Therefore, requiring DS/DSI/DP information to be submitted as part of the BLA, rather than incorporated by reference to a master file, is consistent with FDA's scientific assessment of the risks associated with this category of products and the need for BLA applicants to have direct knowledge of and control over the entire manufacturing process.</P>
                <P>As we acknowledged in the preamble to the proposed rule, there may be some biological products for which referencing a DMF for DS/DSI/DP information presents somewhat less risk. However, FDA declines to adopt a case-by-case approach to BLAs incorporating by reference DS/DSI/DP information contained in master files. Given the complex characteristics of most biological products, the importance of the applicant's knowledge of and direct control over the manufacturing processes for biological products, and the advantages in administrative efficiency and predictability, the Agency is proceeding with an approach that draws a distinction between BLAs and NDAs with regard to the referencing of master files for DS/DSI/DP information, except for certain deemed BLAs (see section V.B.2).</P>
                <P>(Comment 2) One comment suggests that it would be unfair to prohibit sponsors of applications for “biological products” from incorporating by reference DS/DSI/DP information contained in master files while permitting sponsors of applications for “drug products” to do so because it would create unequal starting points and incentives for product development.</P>
                <P>(Response 2) FDA disagrees that it would be unfair to prohibit BLAs from incorporating by reference DS/DSI/DP information contained in master files while permitting applications under the FD&amp;C Act to do so. FDA's longstanding practice of not permitting BLAs to incorporate by reference DS/DSI/DP information contained in master files is based on the differences in risk generally associated with products regulated under the PHS Act and products regulated under the FD&amp;C Act, as described above and in the preamble to the proposed rule.</P>
                <P>
                    With regard to a difference in starting points and incentives, nothing in this rule prohibits an IND for a product that would be subject to licensure under section 351 of the PHS Act from incorporating by reference DS/DSI/DP information contained in a master file, in the same way that an IND can for a product that would be subject to approval under the FD&amp;C Act. Therefore, the starting points for INDs for products that would be regulated under the PHS Act and products that would be regulated under the FD&amp;C Act are the same in this regard. Furthermore, it should be noted that at the BLA stage the inability to incorporate by reference DS/DSI/DP information contained in a master file does not remove BLA applicants' incentives or ability to proceed with product development. An applicant who does not intend to manufacture all aspects of the product for licensure may, as stated in the preamble to the proposed rule, consider other types of cooperative manufacturing arrangements, while still assuming responsibility for meeting the applicable product and establishment standards.

                    <FTREF/>
                     These other arrangements would provide alternatives in cases where the incorporation by reference of a master file is not permitted.

                <P>(Comment 3) Two comments assert that BLAs should be permitted to incorporate by reference DS/DSI/DP information contained in master files because IND applications are permitted to do so.</P>
                <P>(Response 3) FDA disagrees with these comments. FDA requires an applicant to be able to submit DS/DSI/DP information directly to the BLA because, at the time a BLA is submitted, FDA expects the sponsor to have knowledge of and direct control over the manufacturing process.  </P>
                <P>
                    As described in the preamble to the proposed rule, INDs are permitted to incorporate by reference DS/DSI/DP information contained in master files for several reasons, including the following: exposure to the investigational product is limited to subjects enrolled in clinical trials, which are typically carried out in controlled settings; the sponsor and FDA can mitigate risk by closely monitoring patients in clinical trials to evaluate the safety of the investigational 
                    <PRTPAGE P="9747"/>
                    product; and permitting INDs to incorporate by reference DS/DSI/DP information contained in master files may facilitate product development because a sponsor might otherwise choose not to make the significant investment to manufacture the DS/DSI/DP for the product at the early, investigational stage. None of these situations apply at the time of BLA submission.
                </P>
                <P>Because the rationale for permitting INDs to incorporate by reference DS/DSI/DP information contained in a master file does not apply at the BLA stage, FDA declines to change its approach and permit BLAs to incorporate such information by reference.</P>
                <P>(Comment 4) One comment contends that BLAs should be permitted to incorporate by reference DS/DSI/DP information contained in master files because, if there are concerns with the safety of a product during the BLA review process, FDA can issue a complete response letter or request mandatory postmarketing studies and postmarketing surveillance.</P>
                <P>
                    (Response 4) Complete response letters are regulatory responses that convey deficiencies identified by FDA during the review and evaluation of an application. Postmarketing requirements, postmarketing commitments, and postmarketing surveillance are regulatory tools that can be used to assess and address potential product risks after the product is licensed. Complete response letters, postmarketing study commitments, and postmarketing surveillance are application-specific actions. For the reasons discussed above, FDA declines to take a case-by-case (

                     application-specific) approach to BLAs' incorporation by reference of DS/DSI/DP information contained in master files. Furthermore, complete response letters, postmarketing study commitments, and postmarketing surveillance are relevant only after the product has been developed and an application has been submitted to and reviewed and evaluated by the Agency. In contrast, given the importance of the applicant's knowledge of and direct control over the manufacturing processes for biological products, a clear rule that applies to all BLAs provides all applicants with administrative efficiency and predictability early in the development process about the Agency's expectations regarding the use of master files, allowing applicants to take these expectations into account in their product development plan and when preparing content to be submitted in the application.
                </P>
                <P>For the reasons discussed above, FDA declines to take a case-by-case approach, and has concluded that the availability of complete response letters, postmarketing study commitments, and postmarketing surveillance does not provide a suitable alternative to FDA's approach, which is, among other things, intended to provide predictability regarding the use of master files for BLAs.</P>
                <P>(Comment 5) One comment proposes that FDA permit BLAs to incorporate by reference certain kinds of DS/DSI/DP information contained in a master file, advocating for the ability of BLAs to reference DS/DSI/DP information that is not “highly product-specific.” As an example, the comment asserts that “drug product information” could be interpreted to encompass extensive aseptic processing information and, in certain circumstances, this information could be appropriately managed in a master file because elements of aseptic processing can cut across multiple products and very few elements of aseptic processing are drug product-specific. The comment also suggests that platform data to support viral clearance could be more appropriately captured once in a DMF instead of being repeated in multiple BLAs, thereby reducing burden on the Agency and sponsors.</P>
                <P>(Response 5) FDA declines to change its approach in order to permit BLAs to incorporate by reference certain DS/DSI/DP information contained in a master file as suggested by the comment.</P>
                <P>The comment uses, but does not explain what it means by, the term “highly product-specific information,” other than providing examples of information that the comment considers not to be “highly product-specific,” such as platform data to support viral clearance and aseptic processing information. It is unclear whether these examples would, in fact, be DS/DSI/DP information in the context of a particular BLA. FDA notes that an applicant may seek guidance from the relevant review division at the Agency if the applicant is unsure whether information in a master file constitutes DS/DSI/DP information in the context of a particular BLA.</P>
                <P>Accordingly, FDA declines to change this provision to treat DS/DSI/DP information that is not “highly product-specific” different from any other kind of DS/DSI/DP information contained in master files.</P>
                <P>(Comment 6) One comment largely agrees with FDA's proposal and the rationale provided to support it but expresses concern about its application to purely synthetic drug substance intermediates, asserting that the considerations articulated in the proposed rule are appropriate only for biological products. The comment notes that a chemically synthesized polypeptide does not meet the definition of a biological product under section 7002(b) of the BPCI Act, which amended, in part, the definition of a “biological product” in the PHS Act to include a “protein (except any chemically synthesized polypeptide).” The comment requests clarity on the use of DMFs for drug substance intermediates for chemically synthesized polypeptides. The comment contends that some biological products may integrate drug substance intermediates that are chemically synthesized polypeptides. The comment asserts that the potential risks to quality are less significant in such cases because, according to the comment, these chemically synthesized polypeptides are not technically biological products. The comment contends that, under such circumstances, reliance on a DMF may be appropriate, and proposes that FDA allow reliance on a DMF for a drug substance intermediate that is purely synthetic.</P>
                <P>(Response 6) FDA notes that, after the comment period for the proposed rule closed, section 605 of the FCA Act further amended the definition of a “biological product” in section 351(i) of the PHS Act to remove the parenthetical exception for “any chemically synthesized polypeptide” from the statutory category of “protein.” Accordingly, the comment's assertion that BLAs should be permitted to reference a DMF for information about a drug substance intermediate that is a chemically synthesized polypeptide because a chemically synthesized polypeptide does not meet the definition of a biological product is no longer applicable.</P>
                <P>
                    In addition, the inclusion of chemically synthesized polypeptides into the definition of a biological product does not change our overall concerns and approach with respect to biological products. Because chemically synthesized polypeptides can present many of the same issues and concerns as do other biological products, FDA's approach should be the same. When manufacturing processes for chemically synthesized polypeptides are appropriately designed, manufacturers can control the amino acid sequence and modifications to amino acids; however, the manufacturing of chemically synthesized polypeptides may still present risks to quality. As stated in the preamble to the proposed rule, most biological products tend to be 
                    <PRTPAGE P="9748"/>
                    very sensitive to changes in their manufacturing process. For example, aspects of the manufacturing process (
                    <E T="03">e.g.,</E>
                     temperature) can affect the folding of polypeptides. Therefore, even for chemically synthesized polypeptides, it is important for the applicant to have knowledge of and control over all aspects of the manufacturing process and to implement a robust quality assurance program. For this reason, the final rule requires that information about chemically synthesized drug substance intermediates be submitted directly to the application, rather than be incorporated by reference to a master file.
                </P>
                <P>(Comment 7) One comment requests that BLAs for in vitro diagnostic (IVD) products, including those for licensed donor IVD screening tests, be excluded from the limitation on BLAs' incorporating by reference DS/DSI/DP information contained in master files, asserting that the reasons for limiting the use of master files for this kind of information in BLAs for therapeutic products do not apply to BLAs for IVDs.</P>
                <P>(Response 7) FDA declines to exclude BLAs for IVD devices from the limitation on BLAs' use of master files for DS/DSI/DP information because such an exclusion is generally not necessary.</P>
                <P>IVD devices subject to a BLA are intended for use in screening donated human cells, tissues, and cellular and tissue-based products (HCT/Ps) and donated blood in order to ensure the compatibility between donors and recipients and the absence of infectious agents. These assays are performed on samples collected from the HCT/P or blood donor.</P>
                <P>Generally, the terms drug substance, drug substance intermediate, and drug product are not applicable to IVD devices. Therefore, the limitation in this rule on BLAs' use of master files for DS/DSI/DP information is not expected to affect BLAs for IVD devices. For this reason, the Agency considers it unnecessary to exclude BLAs for IVD devices from the scope of the rule's limitation on BLAs' use of master files for DS/DSI/DP information.</P>
                <HD SOURCE="HD3">2. Final § 601.2(g)(2) (Proposed § 601.2(h))</HD>
                <P>Final § 601.2(g)(2) (proposed § 601.2(h)) addresses applications that have been deemed to be BLAs pursuant to section 7002(e)(4) of the BPCI Act, as amended by the FCA Act. This paragraph provides that a deemed BLA can continue to incorporate by reference DS/DSI/DP information contained in a DMF if such information was referenced at the time the application was deemed to be a BLA. We received several comments on this provision, most of which agree with this provision and the rationale provided in the proposed rule. A few comments disagree and several request clarification regarding certain aspects of this paragraph. For the reasons given below, we decline to make the changes suggested by the comments and are, therefore, finalizing this requirement without substantive change.</P>
                <P>(Comment 8) One comment requests clarification regarding proposed § 601.2(h). The comment requests that FDA explain whether all biological products approved in NDAs will be permitted to continue incorporating by reference DS/DSI/DP information contained in DMFs or whether it is only a specific subset of biological products, because the preamble to the proposed rule notes that it would allow “certain” biological products originally approved in an NDA under the FD&amp;C Act to continue relying on a DMF for information on DS/DSI/DP after the NDA is deemed to be a license for the biological product.  </P>
                <P>(Response 8) As explained in the preamble to the proposed rule and described in proposed § 601.2(h), a deemed BLA that was relying on DS/DSI/DP information in a DMF at the time the application was deemed a BLA may continue to incorporate by reference that DS/DSI/DP information contained in that DMF. The reference in the preamble to the proposed rule to “certain” applications refers to deemed BLAs that incorporated by reference DS/DSI/DP information contained in a DMF at the time the application was deemed a BLA. These are the same applications specified in § 601.2(g)(2) in this final rule.</P>
                <P>(Comment 9) One comment requests clarification regarding whether applications that reference DMF information may continue referencing the DMF if changes are made to the DMF.</P>
                <P>(Response 9) The preamble to the proposed rule explains that the rule is not intended to limit or restrict the changes that may be made to any master file, including a DMF containing DS/DSI/DP information. Changes made to such a DMF, including changes to previously referenced DS/DSI/DP information, do not restrict the ability of a deemed BLA to continue to incorporate by reference the DS/DSI/DP information in that DMF for the same purpose for which it was incorporated by reference at the time the application was deemed to be a BLA. For example, consider a former NDA that incorporated by reference information contained in a DMF regarding the manufacture of its drug substance and that, after the application was deemed to be a BLA, continues to incorporate by reference that drug substance information. If the DMF holder subsequently modifies drug substance manufacturing (for example, by making changes to the analytical methods or purification process for the drug substance), the deemed BLA may continue to incorporate by reference this modified drug substance information, provided that the BLA applicant informs the Agency of the change in the BLA in accordance with § 601.12 (21 CFR 601.12). Alternatively, if the DMF holder adds information about manufacturing of drug product to the same DMF, FDA does not intend to permit the deemed BLA to incorporate by reference that new drug product information because it is not the type of information that was referenced by the former NDA at the time it was deemed to be a BLA.</P>
                <P>(Comment 10) One comment requests further information on the circumstances in which submission of a supplement to a BLA would not be sufficient and the submission of a new BLA would be required.</P>
                <P>
                    (Response 10) FDA notes that a description of the kinds of changes that cannot be addressed through a supplement is outside the scope of this rule. The Agency has generally described its thinking on what constitutes a separate original application, amendment, or supplement.

                <P>(Comment 11) One comment suggests that deemed BLAs are best described as “expected to transition.”</P>
                <P>(Response 11) The applications described in § 601.2(g)(2) in this final rule have already been deemed to be BLAs by operation of the statute (section 7002(e)(4) of the BPCI Act, as amended by section 607 of the FCA Act). Therefore, referring to deemed BLAs as “expected to transition” would be inaccurate.</P>
                <P>(Comment 12) One comment suggests that FDA change proposed § 601.2(h) to state that any new BLAs will not be allowed to incorporate by reference DS/DSI/DP information contained in master files after March 23, 2020.</P>
                <P>
                    (Response 12) The Agency declines to make the suggested change. Except as noted in final § 601.2(g)(2) and (3), final § 601.2(g)(1) applies to all BLAs, whether new or existing. Therefore, the suggested change is not needed because, 
                    <PRTPAGE P="9749"/>
                    under the final codified, a new BLA may not incorporate by reference DS/DSI/DP information contained in any master file.
                </P>
                <P>(Comment 13) One comment asserts that the BPCI Act was enacted to guarantee appropriate regulation of biological products to support public health and to ensure that only safe and effective products enter the market. The comment further maintains that the intent of the deemed BLA provision of section 7002(e)(4) of the BPCI Act is to ensure that scientific and technical complexities associated with the generally larger and typically more complex structure of biological products, as well as the processes by which such products are manufactured, are not overlooked. The comment asserts that it would therefore defeat the purpose of the BPCI Act to allow biological products initially approved in an NDA under the FD&amp;C Act to continue to rely on a DMF for DS/DSI/DP information after the NDA is deemed to be a license for the biological product under the PHS Act. The comment recommends that deemed BLAs be regulated like other biological products with respect to use of master files.</P>
                <P>(Response 13) FDA agrees that, in general, scientific and technical complexities associated with the typically more complex structures of biological products, as well as the processes by which such products are manufactured, must not be overlooked (see section V.B.1). However, with respect to deemed BLAs that previously, as former NDAs, referenced a DMF for DS/DSI/DP information at the time of the transition, FDA considered the intent underlying the BPCI Act and, as elaborated in the proposed rule, took into account the following considerations that are specific to such deemed BLAs: (1) these applications have already been approved, and the applicants have marketed the product, in certain instances for decades, without overt safety concerns; (2) the deemed BLAs that incorporate by reference DS/DSI/DP information comprise only a small subset of all BLAs and reference a very small number of DMFs; and (3) many of these BLA applicants have accumulated knowledge about the products and have been able to implement appropriate control strategies based on this product knowledge. In addition, prohibiting these deemed BLAs from continuing to incorporate by reference DS/DSI/DP information in these DMFs might have the effect of halting or curtailing production of these products, resulting in drug shortages. FDA interprets the applicable statutory provisions such that the transition was not meant to interrupt access to these products. Therefore, on balance, FDA believes that public health is best served by allowing the small number of deemed BLAs to continue referencing DS/DSI/DP information contained in DMFs on which they relied at the time of transition.</P>
                <P>(Comment 14) One comment acknowledges that the general concern about fragmentation of DS/DSI/DP information associated with the use of DMFs is lessened for deemed BLAs by the existence of generally longstanding relationships between the deemed-BLA applicants and the DMF holders because the applicants may have accumulated knowledge about the quality of the DS/DSI/DP supplied by the DMF holder over an extended period. The comment agrees that this accumulated knowledge allows a deemed BLA applicant to implement a more robust control strategy to mitigate the risk to product quality posed by the applicant's limited knowledge of the manufacturing process described in the DMF. The comment questions how this approach would change if the contents of the DMF change or the holder of the DMF changes.</P>
                <P>(Response 14) FDA does not consider that a change to the holder of the DMF or a change in previously referenced DS/DSI/DP information in the context of a DMF is inconsistent with the rationale for permitting deemed BLAs that previously referenced a master file for DS/DSI/DP information to continue referencing the DMF for the same type of information. The generally longstanding relationships between the deemed BLA applicant and the DMF holder, the knowledge accumulated by the deemed BLA applicant, and the knowledge accumulated by the DMF holder collectively provide some assurance about the quality of a product. When changes are made to a DMF, these assurances should continue to apply in most cases. In addition, the comparability studies required to demonstrate the safety, purity, and potency of post-change and pre-change material should provide further assurance of quality.</P>
                <P>When the DMF remains the same but the DMF holder changes, the deemed BLA applicant's product and process knowledge still remains; the deemed BLA applicant will also have designed and implemented a control strategy that is independent of the identity of the holder of the DMF. These measures collectively should provide continued assurance of quality under such circumstances. Therefore, it is appropriate to permit deemed BLAs to continue to incorporate by reference the same type of DS/DSI/DP information contained in a DMF after a change in the content of the DMF or the holder of the DMF.  </P>
                <P>(Comment 15) One comment asserts that FDA's rationale for allowing deemed BLAs to continue incorporating by reference information on DS/DSI/DP contained in DMFs is insufficient because it is based on a small subset of the deemed BLAs and a very small number of DMFs.</P>
                <P>(Response 15) This comment appears to misunderstand the set of deemed BLAs on which FDA's rationale is based. It is true that FDA's approach to deemed BLAs and their use of DMFs for DS/DSI/DP information applies to a small number of applications and DMFs. Deemed BLAs are a small subset of all BLAs, and deemed BLAs that reference a master file for DS/DSI/DP information are, in turn, a subset of all deemed BLAs. However, FDA's risk-based assessment of deemed BLAs' continued referencing of DMFs for DS/DSI/DP information is based on a consideration of the entire set of deemed BLAs that reference DMFs for such information, and it is only those deemed BLAs that will be able to continue referencing DS/DSI/DP information in a DMF. In other words, FDA considered the entire set of applications and DMFs that will be affected by final § 601.2(g)(2).</P>
                <P>As elaborated in the preamble to the proposed rule, FDA considered the length of time these products have been marketed without being withdrawn or removed for reasons of safety or effectiveness; the acceptable quality of drug substances provided over decades through this incorporation by reference to DMFs; and the impact of disallowing use of DMFs for these deemed BLAs, which has the potential to curtail or halt production of some of these products, resulting in drug shortages with considerable negative impacts on public health. Based on these reasons, and the fact that there are a small number of deemed BLAs and a small number of master files referenced by these applications, the Agency has determined that it serves the public health best to permit these deemed BLAs to continue incorporating by reference the DS/DSI/DP information contained in this small set of master files.</P>
                <P>
                    (Comment 16) One comment proposes that a biosimilar product that references a deemed BLA that incorporates by reference DS/DSI/DP information contained in a master file should also be permitted to incorporate by reference 
                    <PRTPAGE P="9750"/>
                    the same information to assist in demonstrating biosimilarity.
                </P>
                <P>(Response 16) FDA recognizes that an applicant might submit a BLA for a biosimilar or interchangeable biosimilar product to a reference product that is approved in a deemed BLA and is permitted under the exception in final § 601.2(g)(2) to continue incorporating by reference DS/DSI/DP information contained in a DMF. However, for the reasons outlined below, FDA declines to amend the proposed rule to also except such BLAs for biosimilar or interchangeable biosimilar products from final § 601.2(g)(1).</P>
                <P>Consistent with FDA's longstanding practice for BLAs, and as codified in final § 601.2(g)(1), a BLA may not reference a master file for DS/DSI/DP information because a BLA applicant needs to demonstrate knowledge of and direct control over the manufacture of the drug product, which includes manufacture of the drug substance and drug substance intermediate. For reasons discussed above, FDA believes that the public health is best served by allowing a small number of deemed BLAs—those that, in former approved applications under section 505 of the FD&amp;C Act, relied on DMFs for DS/DSI/DP information—to continue referencing that information after being deemed a BLA. However, these reasons, such as avoiding disruptions in existing supply chains for products with deemed BLAs, do not apply to new BLAs, including BLAs for products that are biosimilar to or biosimilar and interchangeable with reference products in such deemed BLAs. We continue to consider that an approach which draws a clear distinction between deemed BLAs and other BLAs with regard to the referencing of master files for DS/DSI/DP information is the most appropriate.</P>
                <P>FDA notes that the lack of ability to reference a master file for DS/DSI/DP information should not preclude the development of a biosimilar or interchangeable biosimilar product to a reference product in a deemed BLA that is permitted to continue incorporating by reference DS/DSI/DP information from a DMF. For example, an application for licensure as a biosimilar typically will include data derived from comparative analytical studies between the proposed biosimilar and the reference product, which should be feasible even if the biosimilar or interchangeable biosimilar product application does not reference DS/DSI/DP information that is incorporated by reference by the deemed BLA for the reference product. Moreover, data derived from comparative clinical studies, among other things, often will be included as part of a demonstration of biosimilarity. In general, a biosimilar applicant should be able to conduct such studies regardless of whether the biosimilar applicant can reference the same DMF for DS/DSI/DP information as the reference product.</P>
                <P>Furthermore, an applicant for a biosimilar or interchangeable biosimilar product that is not permitted to incorporate DS/DSI/DP information by reference to the DMF is not required to manufacture the DS/DSI/DP; as noted above and in the preamble to the proposed rule, alternatives are available, including the use of cooperative manufacturing arrangements that ensure that the licensee for the final product assumes responsibility for compliance with the applicable product and establishment standards.</P>
                <P>Overall, we do not believe that an applicant for a proposed biosimilar or interchangeable biosimilar product would face a barrier to generating the data necessary to demonstrate the biosimilarity or interchangeability of its proposed product to a reference product that incorporates by reference DS/DSI/DP information in a DMF, even if the biosimilar applicant is not permitted to incorporate by reference that same DS/DSI/DP information. Therefore, FDA declines to modify this provision as suggested.</P>
                <P>
                    We note that the Agency has taken steps to help create a more competitive market for biological products, including encouraging the development of biosimilar products, and is working to implement additional measures to maximize clarity and efficiency in biosimilar development.

                <P>Final § 601.2(g)(4) (proposed § 601.2(i)) codifies the Agency's practice of permitting BLAs to incorporate by reference information other than DS/DSI/DP information contained in master files, including in DMFs. Comments that address this proposed provision did not object to FDA's overall approach or the underlying rationale, and some focused on operational aspects of the provision. Therefore, we are finalizing § 601.2(g)(4) without substantive changes.

                    (Response 19) FDA clarifies that this final rule applies to all master files containing information that is being considered for incorporation by reference by a BLA, regardless of the ownership of the master file.

                <P>(Response 20) Final § 601.2(g)(4) codifies that BLAs may incorporate by reference information other than DS/DSI/DP information contained in master files.

                <P>We received several comments disagreeing with our position that, since BLAs for biological products cannot incorporate by reference DS/DSI/DP information contained in a master file, then BLAs should also not be permitted to incorporate by reference such information for a biological product constituent part of a combination product. We also received comments both in support and not in support of permitting BLAs to incorporate by reference DS/DSI/DP information for the non-biological product constituent part(s) of a combination product.

                     We received several comments disagreeing with our position that BLAs will not be permitted to incorporate by reference DS/DSI/DP information contained in a master file for a biological product constituent part of a combination product.
                </P>
                <P>(Comment 22) The comments disagreeing with FDA's proposal regarding biological product constituent parts of a combination product refer to the reasons that the commenters disagree with the Agency's rationale for not permitting BLAs generally to reference master files for DS/DSI/DP information but do not provide a reason for their disagreement that is specific to a biological product constituent part of a combination product.</P>
                <P>(Response 22) The comments do not provide any reason why a BLA should be permitted to reference a master file for DS/DSI/DP information for a biological product constituent part of a combination product. Instead, the comments refer to the arguments they provide for why BLAs more generally should be permitted to incorporate by reference DS/DSI/DP information. In section V.B.1 of this preamble, we explain why we disagree with that position. None of the comments suggest that there is anything unique about a biological product constituent part of a combination product that warrants not extending the approach for BLAs to a biological product constituent part of a combination product in a BLA. Accordingly, we have modified final § 601.2(g)(1) to state that, except as provided, a BLA may not incorporate by reference DS/DSI/DP information contained in a master file, including for a biological product constituent part of a combination product.</P>

                     With regard to the referencing of a master file for information other than DS/DSI/DP information, we did not receive any comments objecting to BLAs' referencing this information for either a biological product constituent part or a non-biological product constituent part of a combination product. Therefore, FDA has decided that these BLAs, like all other BLAs, may incorporate by reference information other than DS/DSI/DP information contained in master files (see section V.B.3). Accordingly, final § 601.2(g)(4) covers the incorporation by reference of information contained in master files that is not DS/DSI/DP information by all BLAs, regardless of whether such information is incorporated by reference for the product or for a constituent part of a combination product.

                     As discussed above, in the preamble of the proposed rule, the Agency specifically requested comments on whether applications for combination products submitted in BLAs should be permitted to incorporate by reference DS/DSI/DP information for any non-biological product constituent part of a combination product. FDA received numerous comments on this topic. Most 
                    <PRTPAGE P="9752"/>
                    of the comments support permitting BLAs to reference master files for DS/DSI/DP information with respect to the non-biological product constituent part(s) of a combination product, while a few comments are against such an approach. The comments we received helped inform our decision to clarify in this final rule that a BLA may incorporate by reference DS/DSI/DP information contained in any master file for any non-biological product constituent part of a combination product.
                </P>
                <P>(Comment 23) Several comments support codifying in the final rule that BLAs are permitted to incorporate by reference DS/DSI/DP information contained in master files for the non-biological product constituent parts of combination products, but the comments do not provide a rationale. Another comment reasons that DMFs for drug products have been relied on for decades and enabling continued referencing of DS/DSI/DP information for the non-biological product constituent part(s) of a combination product in a BLA will allow further development of “superior treatments.” An additional comment suggests that permitting BLAs to reference a master file for DS/DSI/DP information for the non-biological product constituent part(s) of a combination product would enable biological product and small molecule manufacturers to collaborate more efficiently. Finally, one comment analogizes that, because a BLA would be permitted to incorporate any information from the device master file system for a medical device constituent part of a combination product, BLAs should also be able to reference DMFs for DS/DSI/DP information for drug constituent parts.</P>
                <P>(Response 23) We agree that BLAs should be permitted to reference master files for DS/DSI/DP information with respect to the non-biological product constituent part(s) of combination products. As we explained in the preamble to the proposed rule, historically, the Agency has, as a scientific matter, expected applicants to submit information about DS/DSI/DP directly to the BLA for a biological product, rather than have the BLA incorporate it by reference to a master file. However, as a scientific matter, a similar expectation would not apply to applications for non-biological products regulated under the FD&amp;C Act, which are permitted to incorporate by reference DS/DSI/DP information contained in a master file.</P>
                <P>
                    Much of the rationale for why a BLA is not permitted to reference a master file for DS/DSI/DP information does not apply in the case of a non-biological product constituent part of a combination product in a BLA. As we explained in the preamble to the proposed rule, the risk associated with the manufacture of biological products is generally significantly higher than that associated with the manufacture of products regulated under NDAs, which are often less complex.
                    <SU>11</SU>
                    <FTREF/>
                     This is because most biological products tend to have certain features (
                    <E T="03">e.g.,</E>
                     amino acid sequence, glycosylation, folding, cellular phenotype) essential to their intended effect and can be very sensitive to changes to their manufacturing process, which makes them less amenable to characterization than small molecule chemical entities. While these considerations apply to biological product constituent parts of combination products, they generally do not apply to non-biological product constituent parts, which are often relatively simple, homogenous, and fully characterizable by extensive analytical testing. As such, the need for direct knowledge and control in the manufacturing of a non-biological product constituent part is generally mitigated by the ability to define the non-biological constituent part through analytical testing, and the risk associated with such manufacturing is generally lower than that associated with the manufacture of the biological product constituent part.

                    </P>
                </FTNT>
                <P>As two comments suggest, such an approach is consistent with how a non-biological product constituent part of a combination product, such as a drug constituent part, would be treated if it were a standalone product regulated under the FD&amp;C Act. Additionally, we agree with the comment that permitting such referencing of information for non-biological product constituent part(s) could foster innovation by enabling more efficient collaboration between the manufacturer of the non-biological product constituent part and the manufacturer of the final product submitted in a BLA.</P>
                <P>Accordingly, final § 601.2(g)(3) permits BLAs to incorporate by reference DS/DSI/DP information contained in a master file for the non-biological product constituent part(s) of a combination product.  </P>
                <P>(Comment 24) One comment does not support allowing BLAs to incorporate by reference DS/DSI/DP information for the non-biological product constituent part(s) of a combination product. The comment contends that the lack of knowledge and control over a drug constituent part for which a master file is referenced for DS/DSI/DP information introduces risk when that drug constituent part is combined with a biological product constituent part.</P>
                <P>(Response 24) We understand that permitting a BLA to reference a master file for DS/DSI/DP information for a non-biological product constituent part, such as a drug constituent part, that is then combined with a biological product constituent part may introduce additional risk for the final combination product. However, the Agency considers it generally practical for the BLA applicant to confirm the DS/DSI/DP quality characteristics of the non-biological product constituent part through testing. This feasibility of testing and characterizing the non-biological product constituent part generally enables the BLA applicant to implement a robust control strategy for the final combination product that can mitigate the risks to quality arising from the applicant's lack of access to the DS/DSI/DP information for the non-biological product constituent part. Furthermore, the applicant would still be expected at the time of review of the BLA to have sufficient control strategies for the entire combination product, including an appropriate control strategy to mitigate the risk of the applicant not having access to the manufacturing information for the non-biological product constituent part.</P>
                <P>(Comment 25) Another comment is concerned with non-biological product constituent parts categorically being permitted to reference a master file for DS/DSI/DP information because special controls may be necessary for drug constituent parts that are cytotoxic in nature, such as in the case of an antibody-drug conjugate combination product licensed in a BLA.</P>
                <P>
                    (Response 25) FDA acknowledges that the manufacture of cytotoxic drugs requires special expertise and controls to address the risks associated with the toxic nature of the drug, such as the implementation of special air-handling systems to reduce the risk of exposure to the cytotoxic drug by manufacturing personnel. We point out, however, that such controls to address toxicity-related risks differ from the controls that are discussed elsewhere throughout this rulemaking, which address the risks associated with the generally complex manufacturing of biological products. Permitting a BLA to incorporate by reference DS/DSI/DP information contained in a master file for a cytotoxic drug constituent part of a combination product does not increase the toxicity-related risks associated with either the 
                    <PRTPAGE P="9753"/>
                    manufacture of the cytotoxic drug constituent part or the manufacture of the combination product that contains the cytotoxic drug constituent part. Furthermore, the toxicity-related risks associated with the manufacture of a cytotoxic drug constituent part of a combination product licensed in a BLA are unlikely to differ significantly from the toxicity-related risks associated with the manufacture of cytotoxic drug products that are not constituent parts of combination products licensed in BLAs. Therefore, FDA declines to treat cytotoxic drug constituent parts differently from other non-biological product constituent parts and will permit BLAs to incorporate by reference DS/DSI/DP information contained in master files for cytotoxic drug constituent parts of combination products.
                </P>
                <P>(Comment 26) One comment expresses concern that the BLA applicant would have a greater burden to establish a quality assurance program to mitigate the risk if the BLA incorporates by reference DS/DSI/DP information contained in a master file for the non-biological product constituent part of a combination product and this would be costlier and more complex than if the BLA is not permitted to rely on a master file for such information for the non-biological product constituent part.</P>
                <P>(Response 26) To the extent that there is concern that an applicant would find it costlier and more complex to establish a quality assurance program to mitigate the risk associated with the use of a master file for DS/DSI/DP information for the non-biological product constituent part of a combination product than it would be to directly include such information in the BLA, we point out that FDA is not mandating the use of master files under such circumstances.</P>
                <HD SOURCE="HD3">5. Final § 601.2(g)(5) (Proposed § 601.2(j))</HD>
                <P>FDA proposed in § 601.2(j) of the proposed rule that INDs for products that would be subject to licensure under the PHS Act not be restricted from incorporating by reference any information, including DS/DSI/DP information, contained in a master file, including a DMF submitted under § 314.420 (21 CFR 314.420). Several comments support the proposed approach. However, a few comments disagree and recommend that, as is the case for BLAs, an IND for a product that would be subject to licensure under the PHS Act not be permitted to incorporate by reference DS/DSI/DP information.</P>
                <P>(Comment 27) One comment disagrees with FDA's proposed approach of permitting INDs for products that would be subject to licensure under the PHS Act to incorporate by reference DS/DSI/DP information contained in a master file. The comment contends that the approach is unreasonable because, while exposure to the biological product is limited during the IND stage, the IND should still ensure that clinical trial subjects are not exposed to what the comment considers unreasonable harm should the IND incorporate by reference DS/DSI/DP information contained in a master file.</P>
                <P>(Response 27) FDA agrees that it is important to ensure that clinical trial subjects are not exposed to an unreasonable risk of harm but disagrees with the comment's assessment of FDA's approach.</P>
                <P>During early preclinical development for a new product, the primary goal of FDA and sponsors is to ensure that the product is reasonably safe for initial use in humans and to determine whether the test product exhibits pharmacological activity that justifies commercial development. When a product is identified as a viable candidate for further development, the sponsor then focuses on collecting the data and information necessary to establish that the product will not expose humans to unreasonable risks when used in limited, early-stage clinical studies.</P>
                <P>Clinical trials permit the assessment of the safety and efficacy of investigational products from early drug development through the approval process and beyond. To ensure that clinical trial subjects are not exposed to unreasonable risk of harm, FDA has issued numerous regulations governing human subject protection and the conduct of clinical trials, including regulations regarding informed consent (part 50 (21 CFR part 50)) and institutional review boards, which also participate in the oversight of clinical trials (21 CFR part 56).</P>
                <P>All subjects in clinical trials under an IND receive appropriate informed consent that discusses the known benefits and risks. With limited exceptions, investigators must obtain the informed consent of subjects (or their legally authorized representatives) in clinical trials under IND (§ 50.20). In seeking informed consent, certain information is provided to subjects, including a description of reasonably foreseeable risks and a description of benefits that may reasonably be expected (§ 50.25).</P>
                <P>Furthermore, safety monitoring is not static and continues to apply as product development progresses. IND regulations in part 312 (21 CFR part 312) set forth safeguards that are designed to ensure such safety. Sponsors are expected to continue to ensure the safety of subjects and, as new safety information is identified, to take appropriate steps, which may include incorporating additional safety monitoring and updating the informed consent form. FDA has authority to place an investigation on clinical hold (§ 312.42) if it finds that human subjects are or would be exposed to an unreasonable and significant risk of illness or injury. IND regulations at § 312.56 state that a sponsor who determines that its investigational drug presents an unreasonable and significant risk to subjects must discontinue those investigations that present the risk.</P>
                <P>As explained above and in the preamble to the proposed rule, exposure to the investigational product is limited at the IND stage because the product is only administered to subjects enrolled in clinical trials, which are typically carried out in controlled settings. The controlled nature of a clinical trial allows for close safety monitoring of these subjects, rapid identification of any safety issues that may arise, and implementation of corresponding mitigation strategies.  </P>
                <P>For these reasons, FDA considers that the existing safeguards available in the IND process are sufficient to ensure that subjects participating in clinical trials, including those for products that would ultimately be regulated under BLAs and for which the INDs incorporate by reference DS/DS/DP information contained in master files, are not exposed to unreasonable risk of harm.</P>
                <P>(Comment 28) Another comment expresses concern that the sponsor of an IND for a product that would be subject to licensure under the PHS Act that incorporates DS/DSI/DP information by reference to a master file may not be able to develop the necessary knowledge and control over the manufacturing process when product development reaches the BLA stage. Therefore, the comment suggests setting a deadline during the development stage by which time the sponsor needs to demonstrate knowledge and control over the manufacturing process and can no longer incorporate by reference DS/DSI/DP information from a master file.</P>
                <P>
                    (Response 28) FDA notes that a deadline to develop the requisite knowledge and direct control is not necessary because the submission of the BLA effectively serves as a deadline. As 
                    <PRTPAGE P="9754"/>
                    noted in the preamble to the proposed rule, it has been FDA's practice to permit INDs for products that would be subject to licensure under the PHS Act to incorporate by reference DS/DSI/DP information contained in a master file. By later stages of development, however, FDA requires the sponsors to have knowledge of and direct control over the manufacturing process, and to be able to submit DS/DSI/DP information directly to the BLA. A sponsor can plan its product development to ensure that, at the time the BLA is submitted, the sponsor is able to meet these requirements.
                </P>
                <P>(Comment 29) Several comments agree with the Agency's proposed approach with respect to INDs for products that would be subject to licensure under the PHS Act and the referencing of master files for information including DS/DSI/DP information. One comment suggests that allowing the referencing of DS/DSI/DP information at the IND stage could promote product development and proposes that this benefit be explicitly included in the corresponding codified section. Another comment advises that permitting INDs for products that would be subject to licensure under the PHS Act to reference master files for DS/DSI/DP information ensures that previous knowledge is leveraged.</P>
                <P>(Response 29) We agree that not limiting the ability of INDs for products that would be subject to licensure under the PHS Act to reference a master file for DS/DSI/DP information may facilitate product development. As we explained in the preamble of the proposed rule, and as discussed above, without this option a sponsor might not choose to make the significant investment to manufacture the necessary DS/DSI/DP for a product at this early stage of development. However, we do not think it is necessary to add an explicit reference to the benefit of promoting product development to the codified language.</P>
                <HD SOURCE="HD3">6. Other Issues Raised by Commenters</HD>
                <P>(Comment 30) One comment suggests that it would be helpful if the Agency defined the term “drug substance intermediate,” especially in reference to combination products.</P>
                <P>
                    (Response 30) FDA is not defining the term “drug substance intermediate” in this rule because such a definition would have implications beyond the scope of this rule. FDA will consider whether to provide a definition in rulemaking that has a broader scope since the term is used throughout the BLA regulations.

                    (Comment 31) One comment requests that FDA outline any plans for publication of guidances that more clearly articulate the Agency's current thinking on specific kinds of master files (

                     those containing information on autoinjectors, on fillers, or those owned by CMOs) that may be referenced in BLAs, to enable appropriate referencing of relevant master files, thereby promoting improved compliance and reducing the risk of delays in application reviews.
                </P>
                <P>(Response 31) FDA will take this suggestion under consideration with respect to the development of future guidances. FDA annually publishes nonbinding lists of new and revised draft guidance documents that it plans to publish in the upcoming calendar year.

                <P>(Comment 32) One comment encourages FDA to undertake modifications to internal processes and training of staff and revise the DMF guidance to implement this rule. Specifically, the comment requests that FDA: (1) update its internal training procedures and relevant procedural documents to ensure that Agency reviewers consistently implement and apply proposed § 601.2(i) during application assessment; (2) update the DMF guidance to improve the format and layout of a DMF to avoid duplicating the content of DMFs across multiple applications and supplements; (3) explore potential technological solutions to permit cross-linking between BLAs and DMFs; and (4) incorporate the feedback provided in this comment into the revised draft guidance “Drug Master Files” (Ref. 5).</P>
                <P>(Response 32) FDA agrees that consistency in the implementation of final § 601.2(g)(4) (proposed § 601.2(i)) is important. As with any regulation, FDA will work to ensure correct and consistent implementation of this rule.</P>

                    Regarding technological solutions to permit cross-referencing between BLAs and DMFs, FDA believes that its recent efforts in the area of electronic submissions of DMFs may address some of the concerns.

                <P>(Comment 33) One comment requests that there should also be provisions established that would notify applicants referencing a DMF when that DMF has been altered (without disclosing proprietary information). The comment notes that such notification would be beneficial to regulators and applicants who would be aware of any changes made by the DMF holder that may improve quality or safety of the final product.</P>
                <P>(Response 33) The purpose of this rule is to clarify when BLAs and INDs for products subject to licensure under the PHS Act can use master files. The operation of a DMF, which is addressed under § 314.420, falls outside the scope of this rule; accordingly, FDA declines to address this issue in this rule.</P>
                <P>(Comment 34) One comment observes that, if a DMF were reviewed prior to submission of an NDA or abbreviated new drug application (ANDA), it would allow companies, especially less established ones, to avoid any issues with referencing an incomplete DMF for their NDA or ANDA filing. Additionally, the comment suggests that FDA should consider eliminating assessment fees to encourage smaller biotech and pharmaceutical companies to develop biosimilars.</P>
                <P>(Response 34) FDA declines to make changes to this final rule that would address these suggestions because the process for incorporating by reference information contained in master files, the timing of such referencing, and the fees related to assessment of DMFs are outside the scope of this rule.</P>
                <P>(Comment 35) One comment notes, without suggesting any changes, that in the description of the proposed rule for proposed paragraph § 601.2(h), FDA should include information on the impact of the transition of an NDA to a BLA on exclusivity of the product.  </P>
                <P>
                    (Response 35) Exclusivity considerations are outside the scope of this rule. We note that FDA has issued guidance that, in part, addresses FDA's 
                    <PRTPAGE P="9755"/>
                    current thinking about its interpretation of section 7002(e) of the BPCI Act and exclusivity.

                <P>(Comment 36) One comment requests that FDA approve stem cells as an alternative to surgery that can be covered by insurance; another comment relates to “pandemic flu” and acquired immunity.</P>

                <P>
                    This final rule is effective 30 days after the date of publication in the 
                    <E T="04">Federal Register</E>
                    .
                </P>
                <HD SOURCE="HD1">VII. Economic Analysis of Impacts</HD>
                <P>We have examined the impacts of the final rule under Executive Order 12866, Executive Order 13563, Executive Order 14094, the Regulatory Flexibility Act (5 U.S.C. 601–612), the Congressional Review Act/Small Business Regulatory Enforcement Fairness Act (5 U.S.C. 801, Pub. L. 104–121), and the Unfunded Mandates Reform Act of 1995 (Pub. L. 104–4).</P>
                <P>Executive Orders 12866, 13563, and 14094 direct us to assess all benefits, costs, and transfers of available regulatory alternatives and, when regulation is necessary, to select regulatory approaches that maximize net benefits (including potential economic, environmental, public health and safety, and other advantages; distributive impacts; and equity). Rules are “significant” under Executive Order 12866 Section 3(f)(1) (as amended by Executive Order 14094) if they “have an annual effect on the economy of $200 million or more (adjusted every 3 years by the Administrator of the Office of Information and Regulatory Affairs (OIRA) for changes in gross domestic product); or adversely affect in a material way the economy, a sector of the economy, productivity, competition, jobs, the environment, public health or safety, or State, local, territorial, or tribal governments or communities.” OIRA has determined that this final rule is not a significant regulatory action under Executive Order 12866 Section 3(f)(1).</P>
                <P>Because this rule is not likely to result in an annual effect on the economy of $100 million or more or meets other criteria specified in the Congressional Review Act/Small Business Regulatory Enforcement Fairness Act, OIRA has determined that this rule does not fall within the scope of 5 U.S.C. 804(2).</P>
                <P>The Regulatory Flexibility Act requires us to analyze regulatory options that would minimize any significant impact of a rule on small entities. Because this rule does not impose new regulatory burden on small entities, other than administrative costs of reading and understanding the rule, we certify that the final rule will not have a significant economic impact on a substantial number of small entities.</P>
                <P>The Unfunded Mandates Reform Act of 1995 (section 202(a)) requires us to prepare a written statement, which includes estimates of anticipated impacts, before issuing “any rule that includes any Federal mandate that may result in the expenditure by State, local, and tribal governments, in the aggregate, or by the private sector, of $100,000,000 or more (adjusted annually for inflation) in any one year.” The current threshold after adjustment for inflation is $177 million, using the most current (2022) Implicit Price Deflator for the Gross Domestic Product. This final rule will not result in an expenditure in any year that meets or exceeds this amount.</P>
                <P>Allowing deemed BLAs for biological products to continue referencing DMFs for DS/DSI/DP information will generate net cost-saving benefits for the private and government sectors. Furthermore, the final rule will provide certainty, promote continuity, and help avoid potential disruptions in the supply of certain biological products that were approved in applications under section 505 of the FD&amp;C Act and deemed, pursuant to section 7004(e) of the BPCI Act, to be licenses for the biological products under section 351 of the PHS Act.</P>
                <P>By allowing certain BLAs to continue referencing a DMF for DS/DSI/DP information, FDA avoids imposing a potential new regulatory burden. Affected entities will incur minimal costs to read and understand the rule. FDA estimates that over 10 years at a discount rate of 7 percent, the final rule will generate annualized net cost savings ranging from $0.40 million to $5.19 million with a primary estimate of $2.80 million; at a discount rate of 3 percent, the final rule will generate annualized net cost savings ranging from $0.37 million to $5.17 million with a primary estimate of $2.77 million. Table 1 summarizes our estimate of the annualized costs and the annualized cost-saving benefits of the final rule.</P>

                <P>
                    On June 13, 2002, HUD published an interim rule (“interim rule”) adding new regulations at 24 CFR part 1006 to implement the NHHBG program. 67 FR 40773. HUD modeled the NHHBG regulations after the Indian Housing Block Grant (IHBG) regulations implemented at 24 CFR part 1000 because NAHASDA authorizes and applies overlapping requirements to both programs.

                <P>HUD has not comprehensively reviewed or amended 24 CFR part 1006 since the interim rulemaking. Since then, Congress has amended statutory requirements, which HUD has implemented for the IHBG program through rulemaking, but not the NHHBG program.</P>

                    Additionally, current NHHBG regulations do not adequately explain how NHHBG's sole funding recipient, the Department of Hawaiian Home Lands (DHHL), may use funds for rental assistance. Prior to fiscal year 2020, the DHHL used NHHBG funds primarily for homeownership housing assistance. In 2019, Hawaii changed administrative rules to allow the DHHL to expand residential lease offerings to include rental housing.

                <P>
                    On January 4, 2023, HUD published a proposed rule in the 
                    <E T="04">Federal Register</E>
                     (88 FR 328) to amend the NHHBG program regulations at 24 CFR part 1006 to provide necessary updates to NHHBG regulations and clarify how the DHHL may use NHHBG program funds for rental housing assistance, as authorized by Title VIII of NAHASDA.
                </P>
                <P>HUD's broad goals in proposing these changes were to decrease DHHL's burden in implementing rental assistance, improve low-income Native Hawaiian families' access to rental assistance, and clarify HUD's program requirement monitoring and enforcement tools. More specifically, the amendments to 24 CFR part 1006 were designed to achieve three outcomes: ensure compliance with the NHHBG program's statutory requirements; promote consistency between NHHBG and IHBG program regulations where the programs' statutory requirements overlap; and clarify the NHHBG regulatory rental assistance framework.</P>
                <P>The preamble to the proposed rule at 88 FR 328 includes a thorough explanation and justification of amendments and new sections.</P>
                <HD SOURCE="HD1">III. This Final Rule</HD>
                <P>This final rule adopts the proposed rule, published at 88 FR 328 (Jan. 4, 2023), with the following revisions, based on public comments.</P>
                <P>
                    First, HUD is striking the proposed definition of “
                    <E T="03">Homeless Family</E>
                    ” at § 1006.10 to allow DHHL to retain flexibility with respect to its approach to homeless families; and changing the definition of “
                    <E T="03">project-based rental assistance</E>
                    ” to add that project-based rental assistance may consist of rental assistance provided through an agreement for use of a DHHL property to account for situations where DHHL owns the building but contracts with an agency to manage the property as a facility where units are rented out.
                </P>
                <P>Second, HUD is revising § 1006.215(f) to allow NHHBG funds to be used for management services not just for units developed with NHHBG funds, but for all units occupied by NHHBG eligible families, to account for the fact that some units occupied by NHHBG eligible families are not developed with NHHBG funds.</P>
                <P>This rule also makes non-substantive changes to the definition of “Person with a disability” for clarity.</P>
                <P>The public comments section further explains these revisions to the proposed rule.</P>
                <HD SOURCE="HD1">IV. Public Comments</HD>
                <P>The public comment period for the proposed rule closed on March 6, 2023. HUD received three distinct comments on the proposed rule. This section presents the significant issues, questions, and suggestions submitted by public commenters, and HUD's responses to these issues, questions, and suggestions. The following sections summarize the comments received on the proposed rule and HUD's responses.</P>
                <HD SOURCE="HD2">General Support</HD>
                <P>Commenters supported the proposed rule. Some commenters stated that they generally support the proposed rule and a commenter specifically supported HUD's proposed additions and revisions to 24 CFR part 1006 but suggested some changes to the proposed regulatory text.</P>
                <P>One commenter stated that they support the effort, through this rulemaking, to reduce the burden on the recipient of NHHBG funds. This commenter stated that the proposed rule would increase availability of assisted rental housing through tenant-based rental assistance and offer Native Hawaiians more choice to reside in communities of their choosing. This commenter also noted that HUD's proposals allow qualifying families to enter into private tenancy agreements, and this would mean rental assistance would cover the initial deposit for eligible families.</P>
                <P>
                    <E T="03">HUD Response:</E>
                     HUD appreciates the participation and feedback of the public during the proposed rule's availability for comment.
                </P>
                <HD SOURCE="HD2">§ 1006.10 Definitions</HD>
                <P>For the proposed definition of “Homeless family” in § 1006.10, one commenter noted that “safe, sanitary and affordable housing” is not defined, questioned the meaning of these terms, and recommended that HUD consider referencing the definition of “homeless” in other HUD regulations, such as 24 CFR 578.3.</P>
                <P>
                    For the proposed definition of “Project-based rental assistance” in § 1006.10, the commenter recommended clarifying the definition by adding “an agreement for the use of a DHHL property” as an alternative to a contract with the owner, such that the first sentence of the definition would read: “
                    <E T="03">Project-based rental assistance</E>
                     means rental assistance provided through an agreement for use of a DHHL property or contract with the owner of an existing structure, where the owner agrees to lease the subsidized units to program participants.” The commenter reasoned that where DHHL owns the building but contracts with an agency to manage the property as a facility where units are rented out, an agreement may be required.
                </P>
                <P>
                    <E T="03">HUD Response:</E>
                     HUD appreciates the comment requesting clarification of “safe, sanitary, and affordable housing” within the proposed definition of “Homeless family.” The proposed definition was intended to codify existing policy and align the NHHBG regulations with the regulations for the IHBG program, not to introduce new requirements that may conflict with current practice. Because the proposed rule does not have any requirements related to the “Homeless family” definition, HUD has determined a definition for “Homeless family” is not necessary, will strike the proposed 
                    <PRTPAGE P="9759"/>
                    definition, and declines to adopt or reference the definition of “homeless” that appears at 24 CFR 578.3. This will allow DHHL to retain flexibility with respect to its approach to homeless families, without applying a definition that may prove limiting or incompatible with the unique nature of the NHHBG program. HUD appreciates the comment about the definition of “Project-based rental assistance” (PBRA) and acknowledges the suggested edit as it supports the different scenarios that could arise with project based rental assistance in the NHHBG program. HUD accepts the suggested edit to the definition of PBRA and has updated the regulatory text accordingly.

                <HD SOURCE="HD2">§ 1006.215 Housing Management Services</HD>
                <P>One commenter supported the proposed addition of costs of the operation and maintenance of units developed with NHHBG funds to § 1006.215 but recommended that the language “units developed with NHHBG funds” be replaced with “units occupied by NHHBG eligible families” because other funds received by DHHL (for example, from the state of Hawaii) may be used to construct units receiving NHHBG funds for operation and maintenance. The language at paragraph (f) would then read: “The costs of operation and maintenance of units occupied by NHHBG eligible families.”</P>

                    <E T="03">HUD Response:</E>
                     HUD supports allowing DHHL the ability to expand making affordable housing available to as many families as possible. HUD agrees with the commenter's suggested edit and has updated the regulatory text accordingly.
                </P>
                <HD SOURCE="HD2">§ 1006.301 Eligible Families</HD>
                <P>For the income eligibility criteria proposed in § 1006.301(b)(3), one commenter expressed concern with using median income for eligibility criteria in the state of Hawaii because wealthy families' income can distort the median income of the population. Due to these distortions, this commenter is concerned that permitting DHHL to use 10 percent of its planned Housing Plan for families whose income is 81 to 100 percent of the median income will inaccurately represent income within the state.</P>
                <P>
                    <E T="03">HUD Response:</E>
                     Median income is the standard used in HUD programs to determine eligibility for assistance. HUD annually calculates median family income using Fair Market Rents to determine very low-income, low-income, and extremely low-income limits for programs across HUD, including the Section 8 program. Further, the proposed language aligns with the IHBG program, which publishes yearly income limits under NAHASDA based on median family income. Using median family income provides consistent interpretation of NAHASDA income limits within HUD and allows DHHL to use a small portion of funds to serve over-income families if it chooses to do so. It is not practicable or equitable for the NHHBG program to deviate from other HUD programs when determining income limits. As such, HUD will keep the proposed regulatory language.

                <HD SOURCE="HD2">§ 1006.307 Non-Low-Income Families</HD>
                <P>A commenter said that improved income situations should not disqualify families currently receiving assistance from receiving further assistance.</P>
                <P>
                    <E T="03">HUD Response:</E>
                     HUD appreciates the commenter's response. The proposed language allows families whose income circumstances improve to continue to participate in the program in accordance with DHHL's admission and occupancy policies. This is a long-standing policy that is being codified and is consistent with the IHBG program.

                <HD SOURCE="HD2">§ 1006.375 Other Federal Requirements: Housing Counseling</HD>
                <P>A commenter recommended changing HUD's proposed § 1006.375(d) by removing “or provided in connection with,” so that the paragraph reads: “Housing counseling, as defined in § 5.100, that is funded with NHHBG funds must be carried out in accordance with 24 CFR 5.111.” The commenter reasoned that limiting the federal requirements to housing counseling funded with NHHBG funds gives DHHL greater flexibility for the significant funding from the State.</P>
                <P>
                    <E T="03">HUD Response:</E>
                     HUD appreciates the commenter's suggestion, but HUD declines to accept it. The housing counseling requirements at 24 CFR part 5 are standard requirements applicable to all HUD programs unless inconsistent with the authorizing statute for that program. HUD's position is to maintain consistency in providing housing counseling via HUD-certified housing counselors across HUD programs. The commenter's suggested modification to 24 CFR 1006.375 conflicts with 24 CFR 5.111(a), which requires housing counseling from a HUD certified housing counselor when provided under, or in connection with, any program administered by HUD. Accordingly, any housing counseling provided in connection with NHHBG assistance must be provided by a HUD-certified housing counselor to comply with 24 CFR 5.111 and to maintain consistency with other HUD programs where housing counseling is involved.

                <HD SOURCE="HD2">§ 1006.377 Other Federal Requirements: Displacement, Relocation, and Acquisition  </HD>
                <P>In HUD's proposed § 1006.377(c), outlining relocation assistance requirements for displaced persons, a commenter asked HUD to remove the requirement that wherever possible, minority persons shall be given reasonable opportunities to relocate to dwellings “not located in an area of minority concentration, that are within their financial means” (leaving the requirement that relocation be to “comparable and suitable decent, safe, and sanitary replacement dwellings”). This commenter reasoned that the specified relocation requirements may be difficult to attain depending on the island and area where units may be found within a family's means.</P>
                <P>
                    <E T="03">HUD Response:</E>
                     HUD has considered the comment but declines to make the proposed change. The language the commenter highlights is directly from the Uniform Relocation Assistance and Real Property Acquisition Policies Act of 1970 (URA) regulation at 49 CFR 24.205(c)(2)(ii)(D) and is not subject to changes under this rulemaking. HUD recognizes it may not always be feasible to relocate displaced individuals to areas not of a minority concentration. However, given that 49 CFR 24.205(c)(2)(ii)(D) already provides flexibility for when it is not possible to relocate individuals to areas not of a minority concentration, HUD does not agree that additional flexibility or removal of the requirement when feasible is necessary.

                <P>
                    Under Executive Order 12866 (Regulatory Planning and Review), a determination must be made whether a regulatory action is significant and, therefore, subject to review by the Office of Management and Budget (OMB) in accordance with the requirements of the order. Executive Order 13563 (Improving Regulations and Regulatory Review) directs executive agencies to analyze regulations that are “outmoded, ineffective, insufficient, or excessively burdensome, and to modify, streamline, expand, or repeal them in accordance with what has been learned.” Executive Order 13563 also directs that, where relevant, feasible, and consistent with regulatory objectives, and to the extent permitted by law, agencies are to identify and consider regulatory 
                    <PRTPAGE P="9760"/>
                    approaches that reduce burdens and maintain flexibility and freedom of choice for the public. Executive Order 14094 entitled “Modernizing Regulatory Review” amends section 3(f) of Executive Order 12866 (Regulatory Planning and Review), among other things.
                </P>
                <P>HUD's revisions to NHHBG program requirements and regulations would clarify that NHHBG funds can be used for certain affordable housing activities including project-based rental assistance, permit rental assistance to be provided off the Hawaiian Home Lands when Congress authorizes such use through appropriations acts, and add or change certain requirements for low-income and non-low-income families. However, there is no significant impact because DHHL is the sole recipient of NHHBG funds. This rule was not subject to OMB review. This rule is not a “significant regulatory action” as defined in Section 3(f) of Executive Order 12866 and is not an economically significant regulatory action.</P>

                    ), generally requires an agency to conduct a regulatory flexibility analysis of any rule subject to notice and comment rulemaking requirements unless the agency certifies that the rule will not have a significant economic impact on a substantial number of small entities. This rule will amend HUD regulations to implement rental housing assistance for the NHHBG program, consistent with title VIII of NAHASDA. These amendments impose no significant economic impact on a substantial number of small entities, and there is only a singular recipient of funding. Therefore, the undersigned certifies that this final rule will not have a significant impact on a substantial number of small entities.

                             The maximum monthly tenant rent payment for a low-income family may not exceed 30 percent of the family's monthly adjusted income. DHHL may also decide to compute rental or homebuyer payments on any lesser percentage of the adjusted income of the family. The Act does not set minimum rent or homebuyer payments; however, DHHL may do so.

                             Flat rent means the tenant's rent payment is set at a specific dollar amount or specific percent of market rent. Income-adjusted rent means the tenant's rent payment varies based on the tenant's income (

                             Utilities may be considered a part of rent or homebuyer payments if DHHL decides to define rent or homebuyer payments to include utilities in its written policies on rents and homebuyer payments required by section 811(a)(1) of NAHASDA. DHHL may define rents and homebuyer payments to exclude utilities.

Furthermore, the unit must also meet the requirements of section 504 of the Rehabilitation Act (29 U.S.C. 794) as implemented by HUD's regulations at 24 CFR part 8, subpart C.

                             A person who disagrees with the DHHL's determination concerning whether the person qualifies as a “displaced person,” or the amount of relocation assistance for which the person is eligible, may file a written appeal of that determination with the DHHL in accordance with URA requirements of 49 CFR 24.10.

                             (1) For purposes of this section, the term “displaced person” means any person (household, business, nonprofit organization, or farm) that moves from real property, or moves his or her personal property from real property, permanently, as a direct result of rehabilitation, demolition, or acquisition for a project assisted under the Act. The term “displaced person” includes, but is not limited to:

Such reasonable terms and conditions include a monthly rent and estimated average monthly utility costs that do not exceed the greater of:</P>
                        <P>(A) The tenant-occupant's monthly rent and estimated average monthly utility costs before the agreement; or</P>

                        <P>(v) A tenant-occupant of a dwelling who moves from the building/complex after he or she has been required to move to another dwelling unit in the same building/complex in order to carry out the project, if either:</P>
                        <P>(A) The tenant-occupant is not offered reimbursement for all reasonable out-of-pocket expenses incurred in connection with the move; or</P>

                        <P>(2) Notwithstanding the provisions of this section for the definition of “Displaced Person,” a person does not qualify as a “displaced person” (and is not eligible for relocation assistance under the URA or this section), if:</P>

                        <P>(ii) The person meets the definition of “persons not displaced” as defined in 49 CFR 24.2; or</P>
                        <P>(iii) The DHHL determines the person is not displaced as a direct result of acquisition, rehabilitation, or demolition for an assisted project. To exclude a person on this basis, HUD must concur in that determination in accordance with 49 CFR 24.2.</P>
                        <P>(3) The DHHL may at any time ask HUD to determine whether a specific displacement is or would be covered under this section.</P>

                <HD SOURCE="HD1">I. Statutory Process for Implementing Annual Inflation Adjustments</HD>
                <P>Section 701 of the Bipartisan Budget Act of 2015, Public Law 114–74 (Nov. 2, 2015) (“BBA”), 28 U.S.C. 2461 note, substantially revised the prior provisions of the Federal Civil Monetary Penalties Inflation Adjustment Act of 1990, Public Law 101–410 (the “Inflation Adjustment Act”), and substituted a different statutory formula for calculating inflation adjustments on an annual basis.</P>
                <P>
                    In accordance with the provisions of the BBA, on June 30, 2016 (81 FR 42491), the Department of Justice published an interim rule (“June 2016 interim rule”) to adjust for inflation the civil monetary penalties assessed or enforced by components of the Department after August 1, 2016, with respect to violations occurring after November 2, 2015, the date of enactment of the BBA. Readers may refer to the 
                    <E T="02">SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION</E>
                     (also known as the preamble) of the Department's June 2016 interim rule for additional background information regarding the statutory authority for 
                    <PRTPAGE P="9765"/>
                    adjustments of civil monetary penalty amounts to take account of inflation and the Department's past implementation of inflation adjustments. The June 2016 interim rule was finalized without change by the publication of a final rule on April 5, 2019 (84 FR 13525).
                </P>
                <P>After the initial adjustments in 2016, the BBA also provides for agencies to adjust their civil penalties on January 15 of each year to account for inflation during the preceding year, rounded to the nearest dollar. Accordingly, on February 3, 2017 (82 FR 9131), and on January 29, 2018 (83 FR 3944), the Department published final rules pursuant to the BBA to make annual inflation adjustments in the civil monetary penalties assessed or enforced by components of the Department after those dates, with respect to violations occurring after November 2, 2015.</P>
                <P>The Department has continued to promulgate rules adjusting the civil money penalties for inflation thereafter. Most recently, the Department published a final rule on January 30, 2023 (88 FR 5776), to adjust the civil money penalties to account for inflation occurring since 2022.</P>
                <HD SOURCE="HD1">II. Inflation Adjustments Made by This Rule</HD>
                <P>
                    As required, the Department is publishing this final rule to adjust for 2024 the Department's current civil penalties. Under the statutory formula, the adjustments made by this rule are based on the Bureau of Labor Statistics' Consumer Price Index for October 2023. The OMB Memorandum for the Heads of Executive Departments and Agencies M–24–07 (Dec. 19, 2023) 
                    <E T="03">https://www.whitehouse.gov/wp-content/uploads/2023/12/M-24-07-Implementation-of-Penalty-Inflation-Adjustments-for-2024.pdf</E>
                     (last visited Dec. 21, 2023) instructs that the applicable inflation factor for this adjustment is 1.03241.
                </P>
                <P>Accordingly, this rule adjusts the civil penalty amounts in 28 CFR 85.5 by applying the inflation factor of 1.03241 mechanically to each of the civil penalty amounts listed (rounded to the nearest dollar).</P>
                <P>
                    <E T="03">Example:</E>
                </P>
                <P>• In 2016, the Program Fraud Civil Remedies Act penalty was increased to $10,781 in accordance with the adjustment requirements of the BBA.</P>
                <P>• For 2017, where the applicable inflation factor was 1.01636, the existing penalty of $10,781 was multiplied by 1.01636 and revised to $10,957.</P>
                <P>• Similar adjustments have been made in the following years, through 2023, where the applicable inflation factor was 1.07745, and the existing penalty of $12,537 was multiplied by 1.07745 and revised to $13,508.</P>
                <P>• For this final rule in 2024, where the applicable inflation factor is 1.03241, the existing penalty of $13,508 is multiplied by 1.03241 and rounded to the nearest dollar. The revised penalty is now $13,946.</P>
                <P>This rule adjusts for inflation civil monetary penalties within the jurisdiction of the Department of Justice for purposes of the Inflation Adjustment Act, as amended. Other agencies are responsible for the inflation adjustments of certain other civil monetary penalties that the Department's litigating components bring suit to collect. The reader should consult the regulations of those other agencies for inflation adjustments to those penalties.</P>
                <HD SOURCE="HD1">III. Effective Date of Adjusted Civil Penalty Amounts</HD>
                <P>Under this rule, the adjusted civil penalty amounts for 2024 are applicable only to civil penalties assessed after February 12, 2024, with respect to violations occurring after November 2, 2015, the date of enactment of the BBA.</P>
                <P>The penalty amounts set forth in the existing provisions of 28 CFR 85.5, and its accompanying table, are applicable to all covered civil penalties assessed after August 1, 2016, and on or before February 12, 2024, with respect to violations occurring after November 2, 2015.</P>
                <P>
                    The revised table in this rule lists the civil penalty amounts as adjusted in 2024, 2023, 2022, and 2021. For penalties assessed prior to the adjustment rule adopted in 2021, section 85.5(c) of this rule directs readers back to the 2020 version of the rule, as published in the 
                    <E T="04">Federal Register</E>

                </P>
                <P>Civil penalties for violations occurring on or before November 2, 2015, and assessments made on or before August 1, 2016, will continue to be subject to the civil monetary penalty amounts set forth in the Department's regulations in 28 CFR parts 20, 22, 36, 68, 71, 76, and 85 as such regulations were in effect prior to August 1, 2016 (or as set forth by statute if the amount had not yet been adjusted by regulation prior to August 1, 2016).

Accordingly, this rule is being issued as a final rule without prior notice and public comment, and without a delayed effective date.</P>

                <P>This final rule has been drafted in accordance with Executive Order 12866, “Regulatory Planning and Review,” section 1(b), The Principles of Regulation, in accordance with Executive Order 13563, “Improving Regulation and Regulatory Review,” section 1, General Principles of Regulation, and in accordance with section 1(b), General Principles of Regulation; and Executive Order 14094, “Modernizing Regulatory Review”. Executive Orders 12866 and 13563 direct agencies, in certain circumstances, to assess all costs and benefits of available regulatory alternatives and, if regulation is necessary, to select regulatory approaches that maximize net benefits (including potential economic, environmental, public health and safety effects, distributive impacts, and equity).</P>
                <P>The Department of Justice has determined that this rule is not a “significant regulatory action” under Executive Order 12866, “Regulatory Planning and Review,” section 3(f), and, accordingly, this rule has not been reviewed by the Office of Management and Budget. This final rule implements the BBA by making an across-the-board, mechanical adjustment of the civil penalty amounts in 28 CFR 85.5 to account for inflation since the adoption of the Department's final rule published on January 30, 2023 (88 FR 5776).</P>

                <P>The Coast Guard is issuing this temporary rule under authority in 5 U.S.C. 553(b)(B). This statutory provision authorizes an agency to issue a rule without prior notice and opportunity to comment when the agency for good cause finds that those procedures are “impracticable, unnecessary, or contrary to the public interest.” The Coast Guard finds that good cause exists for not publishing a notice of proposed rulemaking (NPRM) with respect to this rule because it is impracticable. The Coast Guard did not receive final details for this event until January 30, 2024. It is impracticable to go through the full notice and comment rulemaking process because the Coast Guard must establish this safety zone by February 10, 2024, and lacks sufficient time to provide a reasonable comment period and to consider those comments before issuing the rule.</P>
                <P>
                    Also, under 5 U.S.C. 553(d)(3), the Coast Guard finds that good cause exists for making this rule effective less than 30 days after publication in the

Delaying the effective date of this rule would be contrary to public interest because action is necessary to protect personnel, vessels, and the marine environment from the potential safety hazards associated with the fireworks display off Treasure Island, CA on February 10, 2024.
                </P>
                <HD SOURCE="HD1">III. Legal Authority and Need for Rule</HD>
                <P>The Coast Guard is issuing this rule under authority 46 U.S.C. 70034. The Captain of the Port (COTP) San Francisco has determined that potential hazards associated with the scheduled Fireworks Scattering display on February 10, 2024, will be a safety concern for anyone within a 400-foot radius of the fireworks display starting 30 minutes before the fireworks display is scheduled to commence and ending 30 minutes after the conclusion of the fireworks display. For this reason, this temporary safety zone is needed to protect personnel, vessels, and the marine environment in the navigable waters during the fireworks display.</P>
                <HD SOURCE="HD1">IV. Discussion of the Rule</HD>
                <P>This rule establishes a temporary safety zone from 10:30 a.m. until 11:35 a.m. on February 10, 2024, from 30 minutes prior to the start of the fireworks display, and until 30 minutes after the completion of the fireworks display. At 10:30 a.m., which is 30 minutes prior to the commencement of the 5-minute fireworks display, the safety zone will encompass the navigable waters around the fireworks vessel, from surface to bottom, within a circle formed by connecting all points 400-feet out from the coordinates at approximately 37°50′17.9″ N, 122°21′16.5″ W (NAD 83). The safety zone will terminate at 11:35 a.m. on February 10, 2024, or as announced via Marine Information Broadcast.</P>
                <P>
                    This regulation is necessary to keep persons and vessels away from the immediate vicinity of the fireworks scattering site. Except for persons or vessels authorized by the COTP or the COTP's designated representative, no person or vessel may enter or remain in a restricted area. A “designated representative” means a Coast Guard Patrol Commander, including a Coast Guard coxswain, petty officer, or other officer operating a Coast Guard vessel, or a Federal, State, or local officer 
                    <PRTPAGE P="9770"/>
                    designated by or assisting the COTP in the enforcement of the Safety Zone. This regulation is necessary to ensure the safety of participants, spectators, and transiting vessels.

                <HD SOURCE="HD1">V. Regulatory Analyses</HD>
                <P>We developed this rule after considering numerous statutes and Executive orders related to rulemaking. Below we summarize our analyses based on a number of these statutes and Executive orders, and we discuss First Amendment rights of protestors.</P>
                <HD SOURCE="HD2">A. Regulatory Planning and Review</HD>
                <P>Executive Orders 12866 and 13563 direct agencies to assess the costs and benefits of available regulatory alternatives and, if regulation is necessary, to select regulatory approaches that maximize net benefits. This rule has not been designated a “significant regulatory action,” under section 3(f) of Executive Order 12866, as amended by Executive Order 14094 (Modernizing Regulatory Review). Accordingly, this rule has not been reviewed by the Office of Management and Budget (OMB).</P>
                <P>This regulatory action determination is based on the limited duration and narrowly tailored geographic area of the safety zone. Although this rule restrict access to the water encompassed by the safety zone, the effect of this rule will not be significant because local waterways users will be notified to ensure the safety zone will result in minimum impact. The vessels desiring to transit through or around the temporary safety zone may do so upon express permission from the COTP or the COTP's designated representative.</P>
                <HD SOURCE="HD2">B. Impact on Small Entities</HD>
                <P>The Regulatory Flexibility Act of 1980, 5 U.S.C. 601–612, as amended, requires Federal agencies to consider the potential impact of regulations on small entities during rulemaking. The term “small entities” comprises small businesses, not-for-profit organizations that are independently owned and operated and are not dominant in their fields, and governmental jurisdictions with populations of less than 50,000. The Coast Guard certifies under 5 U.S.C. 605(b) that this rule will not have a significant economic impact on a substantial number of small entities.</P>
                <P>While some owners or operators of vessels intending to transit the safety zone may be small entities, for the reasons stated in section V.A above, this rule will not have a significant economic impact on any vessel owner or operator.</P>
                <P>
                    Under section 213(a) of the Small Business Regulatory Enforcement Fairness Act of 1996 (Pub. L. 104–121), we want to assist small entities in understanding this rule. If the rule would affect your small business, organization, or governmental jurisdiction and you have questions concerning its provisions or options for compliance, please call or email the person listed in the 
                    <E T="02">FOR FURTHER INFORMATION CONTACT</E>
                     section.
                </P>
                <P>Small businesses may send comments on the actions of Federal employees who enforce, or otherwise determine compliance with, Federal regulations to the Small Business and Agriculture Regulatory Enforcement Ombudsman and the Regional Small Business Regulatory Fairness Boards. The Ombudsman evaluates these actions annually and rates each agency's responsiveness to small business. If you wish to comment on actions by employees of the Coast Guard, call 1–888–REG–FAIR (1–888–734–3247). The Coast Guard will not retaliate against small entities that question or complain about this rule or any policy or action of the Coast Guard.</P>
                <HD SOURCE="HD2">C. Collection of Information</HD>
                <P>This rule will not call for a new collection of information under the Paperwork Reduction Act of 1995 (44 U.S.C. 3501–3520).</P>
                <HD SOURCE="HD2">D. Federalism and Indian Tribal Governments</HD>
                <P>A rule has implications for federalism under Executive Order 13132, Federalism, if it has a substantial direct effect on the States, on the relationship between the National Government and the States, or on the distribution of power and responsibilities among the various levels of government. We have analyzed this rule under that Order and have determined that it is consistent with the fundamental federalism principles and preemption requirements described in Executive Order 13132.</P>
                <P>Also, this rule does not have tribal implications under Executive Order 13175, Consultation and Coordination with Indian Tribal Governments, because it does not have a substantial direct effect on one or more Indian tribes, on the relationship between the Federal Government and Indian tribes, or on the distribution of power and responsibilities between the Federal Government and Indian tribes.</P>
                <HD SOURCE="HD2">E. Unfunded Mandates Reform Act</HD>
                <P>The Unfunded Mandates Reform Act of 1995 (2 U.S.C. 1531–1538) requires Federal agencies to assess the effects of their discretionary regulatory actions. In particular, the Act addresses actions that may result in the expenditure by a State, local, or tribal government, in the aggregate, or by the private sector of $100,000,000 (adjusted for inflation) or more in any one year. Though this rule will not result in such an expenditure, we do discuss the effects of this rule elsewhere in this preamble.</P>

                <P>
                    We have analyzed this rule under Department of Homeland Security Directive 023–01, Rev. 1, associated implementing instructions, and Environmental Planning COMDTINST 5090.1 (series), which guide the Coast Guard in complying with the National Environmental Policy Act of 1969 (42 U.S.C. 4321–4370f), and have determined that this action is one of a category of actions that do not individually or cumulatively have a significant effect on the human environment. This rule involves a temporary safety zone in the navigable waters surrounding the fireworks vessel within the San Francisco Bay off Treasure Island, CA. It is categorically excluded from further review under paragraph L60(a) of Appendix A, Table 1 of DHS Instruction Manual 023–01–001–01, Rev. 1.

On November 30, 2023, the Connecticut Department of Energy and Environmental Protection (CT DEEP) submitted to EPA the State's adopted regulatory amendments to the definition of “severe non-attainment area for ozone” for inclusion in the EPA-approved SIP and Title V Operating Permit Program. The revision is necessary to fully implement these programs based on a nonattainment reclassification to a portion of Connecticut for the 2008 ozone National Ambient Air Quality Standard. EPA is approving these revisions pursuant to the Clean Air Act (CAA) and implementing federal regulations.</P>

                <P>On July 17, 2023 (88 FR 45373), EPA published a Notice of Proposed Rulemaking (NPRM) for the State of Connecticut. The NPRM proposed approval of a revised definition in the SIP and the Title V Operating Permit Program for the State of Connecticut. On June 9, 2023, CT DEEP requested parallel processing of the revised definition of “severe non-attainment area for ozone” within the Regulations of Connecticut State Agencies (RCSA) 22a–174–1 for approval into the SIP and as a program revision to the State's Title V operating permitting program. Under the parallel processing procedure, EPA proposed approval of the revised definition before the State's final adoption of the definition. Connecticut subsequently adopted the revised definition which became effective on November 13, 2023. The formal revisions to the SIP and the Title V operating permitting program were submitted by Connecticut on November 30, 2023.</P>
                <P>
                    The rationale for EPA's proposed approval of the revised definition in the SIP and the Title V operating permitting program are explained in the NPRM and will not be restated here. EPA is proceeding with our final approval of the November 30, 2023 submitted revisions to the Connecticut SIP and Title V Operating Permit Program, consistent with the parallel processing provisions in 40 CFR part 51, Appendix V. EPA has reviewed Connecticut's adopted definition of “severe non-attainment area for ozone” contained in RCSA 22a–174–1, and it does not differ from the proposed regulation submitted as part of the parallel processing request on June 9, 2023. That is, CT DEEP adopted the revisions as they were proposed,

                     no changes were made.

                <P>EPA received two comments during the comment period; both comments are supportive. As such, these comments do not require further response to finalize the action as proposed. Nevertheless, EPA is including these comments in the docket for this rule.</P>

                <P>EPA is approving Connecticut's revised definition of “severe non-attainment area for ozone,” contained in RCSA 22a–174–1 as amended by the State of Connecticut on November 13, 2023, as a revision to the Connecticut SIP and Title V Operating Permit Program.</P>

                <P>
                    In this rule, the EPA is finalizing regulatory text that includes incorporation by reference. In accordance with requirements of 1 CFR 51.5, the EPA is finalizing the incorporation by reference the revised definition of “severe non-attainment area for ozone” within Connecticut's RCSA section 22a–174–1,

                <P>
                    Under the CAA, the Administrator is required to approve SIP and Title V submissions that complies with the provisions of the Act and applicable Federal regulations. 
                    <E T="03">See</E>
                     42 U.S.C. 7410(k) and 7661a(d); 40 CFR 52.02(a) and 70.4(e). Thus, in reviewing SIP and Title V submissions, EPA's role is to approve State choices, provided that they meet the criteria of the CAA. Accordingly, this action merely approves State law as meeting Federal requirements and does not impose additional requirements beyond those imposed by State law. For that reason, this action:
                </P>
                <P>• Is not a significant regulatory action subject to review by the Office of Management and Budget under Executive Orders 12866 (58 FR 51735, October 4, 1993) and 13563 (76 FR 3821, January 21, 2011);</P>
                <P>
                    • Does not impose an information collection burden under the provisions of the Paperwork Reduction Act (44 U.S.C. 3501 
                    <E T="03">et seq.</E>
                    );
                </P>
                <P>
                    • Is certified as not having a significant economic impact on a substantial number of small entities under the Regulatory Flexibility Act (5 U.S.C. 601 
                    <E T="03">et seq.</E>
                    );
                </P>
                <P>• Does not contain any unfunded mandate or significantly or uniquely affect small governments, as described in the Unfunded Mandates Reform Act of 1995 (Pub. L. 104–4);</P>
                <P>• Does not have federalism implications as specified in Executive Order 13132 (64 FR 43255, August 10, 1999);</P>
                <P>• Is not an economically significant regulatory action based on health or safety risks subject to Executive Order 13045 (62 FR 19885, April 23, 1997);</P>
                <P>• Is not a significant regulatory action subject to Executive Order 13211 (66 FR 28355, May 22, 2001); and</P>
                <P>• Is not subject to requirements of section 12(d) of the National Technology Transfer and Advancement Act of 1995 (15 U.S.C. 272 note) because application of those requirements would be inconsistent with the CAA.</P>
                <P>In addition, the SIP is not approved to apply on any Indian reservation land or in any other area where EPA or an Indian tribe has demonstrated that a tribe has jurisdiction. In those areas of Indian country, the rule does not have Tribal implications and will not impose substantial direct costs on Tribal governments or preempt Tribal law as specified by Executive Order 13175 (65 FR 67249, November 9, 2000).</P>
                <P>Executive Order 12898 (Federal Actions To Address Environmental Justice in Minority Populations and Low-Income Populations, 59 FR 7629, Feb. 16, 1994) directs Federal agencies to identify and address “disproportionately high and adverse human health or environmental effects” of their actions on minority populations and low-income populations to the greatest extent practicable and permitted by law. EPA defines environmental justice (EJ) as “the fair treatment and meaningful involvement of all people regardless of race, color, national origin, or income with respect to the development, implementation, and enforcement of environmental laws, regulations, and policies.” EPA further defines the term fair treatment to mean that “no group of people should bear a disproportionate burden of environmental harms and risks, including those resulting from the negative environmental consequences of industrial, governmental, and commercial operations or programs and policies.”</P>
                <P>CT DEEP did not evaluate environmental justice considerations as part of its SIP submittal; the CAA and applicable implementing regulations neither prohibit nor require such an evaluation. EPA did not perform an EJ analysis and did not consider EJ in this action. Due to the nature of the action being taken here, this action is expected to have a neutral to positive impact on the air quality of the affected area. Consideration of EJ is not required as part of this action, and there is no information in the record inconsistent with the stated goal of E.O. 12898 of achieving environmental justice for people of color, low-income populations, and Indigenous peoples.</P>
                <P>
                    The Congressional Review Act, 5 U.S.C. 801 
                    <E T="03">et seq.,</E>
                     as added by the Small Business Regulatory Enforcement Fairness Act of 1996, generally provides that before a rule may take effect, the agency promulgating the rule must submit a rule report, which includes a copy of the rule, to each House of the Congress and to the Comptroller General of the United States. EPA will submit a report containing this action and other required information to the U.S. Senate, the U.S. House of Representatives, and the Comptroller General of the United States prior to publication of the rule in the 
                    <E T="04">Federal Register</E>
                    . A major rule cannot take effect until 60 days after it is published in the 
                    <E T="04">Federal Register</E>
                    . This action is not a “major rule” as defined by 5 U.S.C. 804(2).
                </P>
                <P>Under section 307(b)(1) of the CAA, petitions for judicial review of this action must be filed in the United States Court of Appeals for the appropriate circuit by April 12, 2024. Filing a petition for reconsideration by the Administrator of this final rule does not affect the finality of this action for the purposes of judicial review nor does it extend the time within which a petition for judicial review may be filed and shall not postpone the effectiveness of such rule or action. This action may not be challenged later in proceedings to enforce its requirements. (See section 307(b)(2).)</P>

Vestaron Corporation submitted a petition to EPA under the Federal Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act (FFDCA), requesting an exemption from the requirement of a tolerance for residues of the U1-AGTX-Ta1b-QA protein in and on all food commodities. This regulation eliminates the need to establish a maximum permissible level for residues of U1-AGTX-Ta1b-QA protein under FFDCA when used in accordance with this exemption.</P>

                    <E T="04">Federal Register</E>
                     of March 22, 2022 (87 FR 16133) (FRL–9410–11–OCSPP), EPA issued a document pursuant to FFDCA section 408(d)(3), 21 U.S.C. 346a(d)(3), announcing the filing of a pesticide tolerance petition (PP 1F8923) by Vestaron Corporation, 600 Park Offices Dr., Suite 117, Research Triangle Park, NC 27709. The petition requested that 40 CFR part 180 be amended by establishing an exemption from the requirement of a tolerance for residues of U1-AGTX-Ta1b-QA protein. That document referenced a summary of the petition prepared by the petitioner Vestaron Corporation, which is available in the docket, 
                    <E T="03">https://www.regulations.gov.</E>
                     EPA received one comment on the notice of filing. EPA's response to this comment is discussed in Unit VII.C.
                </P>
                <HD SOURCE="HD1">III. Final Rule</HD>
                <HD SOURCE="HD2">A. EPA's Safety Determination</HD>
                <P>Section 408(c)(2)(A)(i) of FFDCA allows EPA to establish an exemption from the requirement for a tolerance (the legal limit for a pesticide chemical residue in or on a food) only if EPA determines that the exemption is “safe.” Section 408(c)(2)(A)(ii) of FFDCA defines “safe” to mean that “there is a reasonable certainty that no harm will result from aggregate exposure to the pesticide chemical residue, including all anticipated dietary exposures and all other exposures for which there is reliable information.” This includes exposure through drinking water and in residential settings, but does not include occupational exposure. Pursuant to FFDCA section 408(c)(2)(B), in establishing or maintaining in effect an exemption from the requirement of a tolerance, EPA must take into account the factors set forth in FFDCA section 408(b)(2)(C), which require EPA to give special consideration to exposure of infants and children to the pesticide chemical residue in establishing a tolerance and to “ensure that there is a reasonable certainty that no harm will result to infants and children from aggregate exposure to the pesticide chemical residue. . . .” Additionally, FFDCA section 408(b)(2)(D) requires that the Agency consider “available information concerning the cumulative effects of a particular pesticide's residues” and “other substances that have a common mechanism of toxicity.”</P>
                <P>
                    EPA evaluated the available toxicological and exposure data on U1-AGTX-Ta1b-QA protein and considered their validity, completeness, and reliability, as well as the relationship of this information to human risk. A full explanation of the data upon which EPA relied and its risk assessment based on those data can be found within the document entitled “Human Health Risk Assessment in Support of the Registration of `Basin' End Use Product Containing the New Active Ingredient U1-AGTX-Ta1b-QA (8.5%) and Associated Petition to Establish a Permanent Tolerance Exemption” (Human Health Risk Assessment). This document, as well as other relevant information, is available in the docket for this action as described under 
                    <E T="02">ADDRESSES</E>
                    .
                </P>
                <P>
                    Available data have demonstrated that, with regard to humans, U1-AGTX-Ta1b-QA protein is not anticipated to be toxic or allergenic via any reasonably foreseeable route of exposure. U1-AGTX-Ta1b-QA protein is a modified form of agatoxin protein derived from the venom of the hobo spider (
                    <E T="03">Eratigena agrestis</E>
                    ) that is intended for control of insects and mites. In insects, the reported mode-of-action of U1-AGTX-Ta1b-QA is allosteric inhibition of a non-desensitizing nicotinic acetylcholine receptor, a neural receptor responsible for signal transduction and function. The U1-AGTX-Ta1b-QA protein binds to a non-signaling portion of the target (allosteric) site, altering the three-dimensional structure of the neural receptor. According to the Center of Disease Control (
                    <E T="03">https://www.cdc.gov/niosh/topics/spiders/types.html</E>
                    ), the venom, from which the active ingredient is derived, is not recognized as toxic to humans. Products formulated with U1AGTX-Ta1b-QA will be used for foliar applications to plants or as a dip/immersion for roots or cuttings.
                </P>
                <P>
                    Toxicological data provided by the petitioner indicate that U1-AGTX-Ta1b-QA has low acute toxicity via the oral, dermal, inhalation, route and it is not a dermal or eye irritant. This conclusion is further supported by the results of the 90-day oral toxicity study, prenatal development toxicity studies, and the absence of genotoxicity in a bacterial 
                    <PRTPAGE P="9775"/>
                    reverse mutation test. In addition, the protein sequence of U1-AGTX-Ta1b-QA does not show significant homology to known allergens and thus there is no indication of allergenic cross-reactivity.  
                </P>
                <P>Dietary exposure could occur if U1-AGTX-Ta1b-QA is used on crops used for food. However, any risks associated with dietary exposures are expected to be negligible due to the following hazard and exposure considerations: U1-AGTX-Ta1b-QA (1) has a low overall toxicity profile including low toxicity via the oral route of exposure; (2) does not exhibit protein homology to putative or known allergens; (3) does not show any prenatal developmental toxicity or genetic toxicity; and (4) as described, was derived from the venom of the hobo spider, which is not recognized as toxic to humans. In addition, food crops undergo a post-harvest washing process to remove soil and surface residues, which will therefore reduce the amounts of U1-AGTX-Ta1b-QA on the treated crops. Root dip and cutting immersions, specifically, are expected to result in negligible exposure of above-ground grown plant parts used for food since these applications occur prior to planting and residues are not expected to persist on the growing plant. Exposure through drinking water is expected to be negligible as U1-AGTX-Ta1b-QA, as a protein, is expected to be susceptible to biodegradation in the environment as well as water treatment processes.</P>
                <P>Non-occupational exposure could occur if bystanders are present in areas treated with products containing U1-AGTX-Ta1b-QA protein. However, submitted data have shown that U1-AGTX-Ta1b-QA is expected to have low toxicity via the oral, dermal, and inhalation routes of exposure, is minimally irritating to the eyes and skin, and is not a dermal sensitizer; therefore, any risks from non-occupational exposure are expected to be negligible.</P>
                <P>Based upon the evaluation in the Human Health Risk Assessment, which found no risk of concern from aggregate exposure to U1-AGTX-Ta1b-QA, EPA concludes that there is reasonable certainty that no harm will result to the U.S. population, including infants and children, from aggregate exposure to residues of U1-AGTX-Ta1b-QA. This includes all anticipated dietary exposures and all other exposures for which there is reliable information. In addition, because no threshold effects have been identified for infants and children, EPA determined that an additional Food Quality Protection Act (FQPA) safety factor is not necessary to protect infants and children from anticipated residues of U1-AGTX-Ta1b-QA.</P>
                <HD SOURCE="HD2">B. Analytical Enforcement Methodology</HD>
                <P>An analytical method is not required for U1-AGTX-Ta1b-QA since the Agency is establishing an exemption from the requirement of a tolerance without any numerical limitation based on a lack of adverse effects.</P>
                <HD SOURCE="HD2">C. Response To Comment</HD>
                <P>One comment was received during the public comment period for the notice of filing. The commentor provided general objections to EPA establishing exemptions from tolerance for pesticides but did not provide any specific or substantive objections to the petition to exempt U1-AGTX-Ta1b-QA protein. Based on its review of the data and other information submitted in support of the tolerance exemption petition (as described above in Unit III.A), EPA has determined that a tolerance exemption for U1-AGTX-Ta1b-QA protein is safe under the FFDCA. Therefore, EPA is establishing a tolerance exemption for residues of U1-AGTX-Ta1b-QA protein applied to food commodities.</P>
                <HD SOURCE="HD2">D. Conclusion</HD>
                <P>Based on the conclusions detailed in Unit III.A., an exemption from the requirement of a tolerance is established for residues of U1-AGTX-Ta1b-QA protein in or on all food commodities when used in accordance with label directions and good agricultural practices.</P>
                <HD SOURCE="HD1">IV. Statutory and Executive Order Reviews</HD>
                <P>
                    This action establishes an exemption under FFDCA section 408(d) in response to a petition submitted to the Agency. The Office of Management and Budget (OMB) has exempted these types of actions from review under Executive Order 12866, entitled “Regulatory Planning and Review” (58 FR 51735, October 4, 1993). Because this action has been exempted from review under Executive Order 12866, this action is not subject to Executive Order 13211, entitled “Actions Concerning Regulations That Significantly Affect Energy Supply, Distribution, or Use” (66 FR 28355, May 22, 2001) or Executive Order 13045, entitled “Protection of Children from Environmental Health Risks and Safety Risks” (62 FR 19885, April 23, 1997). This action does not contain any information collections subject to OMB approval under the Paperwork Reduction Act (PRA), 44 U.S.C. 3501 
                    <E T="03">et seq.,</E>
                     nor does it require any special considerations under Executive Order 12898, entitled “Federal Actions to Address Environmental Justice in Minority Populations and Low-Income Populations” (59 FR 7629, February 16, 1994).
                </P>
                <P>
                    Since tolerances and exemptions that are established on the basis of a petition under FFDCA section 408(d), such as the exemption from the requirement of a tolerance in this final rule, do not require the issuance of a proposed rule, the requirements of the Regulatory Flexibility Act (RFA) (5 U.S.C. 601 
                    <E T="03">et seq.</E>
                    ), do not apply.
                </P>
                <P>
                    This action directly regulates growers, food processors, food handlers, and food retailers, not States or tribes, nor does this action alter the relationships or distribution of power and responsibilities established by Congress in the preemption provisions of FFDCA section 408(n)(4). As such, the Agency has determined that this action will not have a substantial direct effect on States or tribal governments, on the relationship between the national government and the States or tribal governments, or on the distribution of power and responsibilities among the various levels of government or between the Federal Government and Indian tribes. Thus, the Agency has determined that Executive Order 13132, entitled “Federalism” (64 FR 43255, August 10, 1999) and Executive Order 13175, entitled “Consultation and Coordination with Indian Tribal Governments” (65 FR 67249, November 9, 2000) do not apply to this action. In addition, this action does not impose any enforceable duty or contain any unfunded mandate as described under Title II of the Unfunded Mandates Reform Act (UMRA) (2 U.S.C. 1501 
                    <E T="03">et seq.</E>
                    ).
                </P>
                <P>This action does not involve any technical standards that would require Agency consideration of voluntary consensus standards pursuant to section 12(d) of the National Technology Transfer and Advancement Act (NTTAA) (15 U.S.C. 272 note).</P>

                    ), EPA will submit a report containing this rule and other required information to the U.S. Senate, the U.S. House of Representatives, and the Comptroller General of the United States prior to publication of the rule in the

                <P>
                    Under 5 U.S.C. 553(b) of the Administrative Procedure Act (the APA), the agency is required to publish a notice of the proposed rule in the 
                    <E T="04">Federal Register</E>
                     before the provisions of a rule take effect. Similarly, section 1871(b)(1) of the Social Security Act (the Act) requires the Secretary to provide for notice of the proposed rule in the 
                    <E T="04">Federal Register</E>
                     and provide a period of not less than 60 days for public comment. In addition, section 553(d) of the APA and section 1871(e)(1)(B)(i) of the Act mandate a 30-day delay in effective date after issuance or publication of a rule. Sections 553(b)(B) and 553(d)(3) of the APA provide for exceptions from the APA notice and comment, and delay in effective date requirements. In cases in which these exceptions apply, sections 1871(b)(2)(C) and 1871(e)(1)(B)(ii) of the Act provide exceptions from the notice, 60-day comment period, and delay in effective date requirements of the Act as well. Section 553(b)(B) of the APA and section 1871(b)(2)(C) of the Act authorize an agency to dispense with normal notice and comment rulemaking procedures for good cause if the agency makes a finding that the notice and comment process is impracticable, unnecessary, or contrary to the public interest, and includes a statement of the finding and the reasons for it in the rule. In addition, section 553(d)(3) of the APA and section 1871(e)(1)(B)(ii) allow the agency to avoid the 30-day delay in effective date where such delay is contrary to the public interest and the agency includes in the rule a statement of the finding and the reasons for it.

                <P>
                    In our view, this correcting document does not constitute a rulemaking that would be subject to these requirements. This document merely corrects technical errors in the CY 2024 PFS final rule. The corrections contained in this document are consistent with, and do not make substantive changes to, the policies and payment methodologies that were proposed, subject to notice and comment procedures, and adopted in the CY 2024 PFS final rule. As a result, the corrections made through this correcting document are intended to resolve inadvertent errors so that the rule accurately reflects the policies adopted in the final rule. Even if this were a rulemaking to which the notice and comment and delayed effective date requirements applied, we find that there is good cause to waive such requirements. Undertaking further notice and comment procedures to incorporate the corrections in this document into the CY 2024 PFS final rule or delaying the effective date of the corrections would be contrary to the public interest because it is in the public interest to ensure that the rule accurately reflects our policies as of the date they take effect. Further, such procedures would be unnecessary because we are not making any substantive revisions to the final rule, but rather, we are simply correcting the 
                    <E T="04">Federal Register</E>
                     document to reflect the policies that we previously proposed, received public comment on, and subsequently finalized in the final rule. For these reasons, we believe there is good cause to waive the requirements for notice and comment and delay in effective date.

Section 455(f) of the Act requires the Secretary to issue regulations governing the grants to Tribes and Tribal organizations operating child support programs.</P>
                <P>This final rule is also published under the authority granted to the Secretary of Health and Human Services by section 1102 of the Act (42 U.S.C. 1302).

                <HD SOURCE="HD1">II. Public Consultation</HD>
                <P>
                    Since the inception of the Tribal child support program, OCSS has conducted numerous face-to-face and virtual Tribal Consultations and listening sessions to discuss the longstanding issue of the non-Federal share requirement and the cost sharing rates.
                    <PRTPAGE P="9785"/>
                </P>
                <P>In fact, even before drafting regulations to implement direct funding for Tribal Child Support Enforcement Programs, OCSS conducted a series of Tribal consultations during which OCSS received many questions about how funding levels would be set. The notice of proposed rulemaking (NPRM), published in August 2000, indicated that “if the Secretary determines based on experience and consultation with Tribes that the 80/20 match rate is disruptive to the program and imposes hardship to Tribes, the regulations will be revised accordingly” (65 FR 50823).</P>
                <P>Since then, Tribal leaders and Tribal child support directors have submitted oral and written feedback, testimony, and blanket waiver requests describing the barriers they face in meeting the non-Federal share requirement and requesting relief by modifying, suspending, or eliminating the requirement.</P>
                <P>
                    Most recently, on April 6, 2023, OCSS held a Tribal Consultation for the NPRM issued on April 21, 2023 (88 FR 24526). Several Tribal leaders or their designees provided oral testimony about the difficulties Tribes and Tribal organizations face in meeting the non-Federal share requirement and the adverse impacts. For example, meeting the non-Federal share forces Tribal child support programs to cut staff, limit services, defer systems or equipment purchases, and compete with other Tribal programs for scarce Tribal funds and resources. They specifically mentioned the importance of Tribal monies to support self-governance functions like public safety, health, and natural resources. Oftentimes, Tribe-Tribes and Tribal organizations must underfund critical self-governance functions and services to meet the non-Federal share. They indicated that Tribal Nations have limited ways to increase revenue, are more susceptible to losses and economic downturns, and do not have the same taxing authorities as state governments. Many discussed the administrative burden of documenting, tracking, and reporting on non-Federal share contributions and how dedicating staff time and resources to that makes their child support programs less efficient and effective. They thought the non-Federal share waiver provision was overly restrictive and unnecessary since the non-Federal share was not imposed by Congress in section 455(f) the Social Security Act but by OCSS through regulation despite the objections of Tribes. They also thought that revising the non-Federal share waiver requirement was not an adequate, long-term solution, especially because that would not remove the financial barrier that prevents prospective Tribes from administering a child support program and places existing Tribal child support programs at risk of closing. All the oral and written testimony supported the elimination of the non-Federal share requirement because it will create stability, promote growth, and ensure Tribal families and communities have access to Tribal child support program services. It also reaffirms the government-to-government relationship between Indian Tribes and the Federal Government. The April 6, 2023, Tribal Consultation Session Summary Report is available on the OCSS website,

These consultations and sessions demonstrate that Tribes and Tribal organizations have consistently and repeatedly objected to the non-Federal share requirement and expressed the hardship and harm it causes.</P>

                    In the 2000 NPRM for the Tribal Child Support Enforcement Programs, OCSS estimated that within 3 years, 150 Tribes and Tribal organizations would operate a child support program (65 FR 50801). As one commenter pointed out, the expansion of the Tribal child support program has fallen significantly short of those earlier projections. To date, few Tribes and Tribal organizations operate child support programs, although funding was authorized 19 years ago. Out of the 574 federally recognized Tribes, only 60 operate Tribal child support programs despite the flexible eligibility requirements to receive program funding.

                    Eliminating the non-Federal share requirement, including the 90/10 and 80/20 cost sharing rates, removes a significant financial barrier for current and prospective Tribal child support programs. Many Tribes and Tribal organizations face systemic, historical, and ongoing issues that impact their ability to meet the non-Federal share.

                     For example, some Tribes have high rates of unemployment and families living below the poverty level, have limited and vulnerable Tribal enterprises that generate revenue, are in rural, communities that have faced disinvestment, are exposed to greater environmental threats, and lack robust economies. One comment indicated that many Tribes are shut out of the opportunity to provide federally funded child support services precisely because of long-term problems like high unemployment rates, limited economic development, a subsistence economy remote from employment centers, and no tax base. The non-Federal share requirement not only discourages prospective Tribes, it also increases the risk of current Tribal child support programs shutting down.

                <P>Several Tribal commenters expressed their fears of being forced to shut down their Tribal child support programs if the non-Federal share is not eliminated. In fact, in fiscal year (FY) 2017, a Tribe had to shut down their child support program because they were unable to meet the non-Federal share of program expenditures, indicating that the requirement is a barrier for any Tribe to be successful.</P>
                <P>Additionally, the current economic conditions in Tribal Nations have made their situations even more precarious. Several Tribal commenters indicated that their enterprises and revenues have not fully returned to pre-pandemic levels, and they are still dealing with other issues like the opioid epidemic and natural disasters that require Tribal resources and funds to mitigate. Yet, the non-Federal share requirement forces Tribal child support programs to compete with other Tribal departments and programs to obtain limited Tribal government funding.</P>
                <P>
                    The elimination of the non-Federal share requirement will enable Tribal child support programs to grow and expand. Meeting the non-Federal share has disproportionately and negatively driven programmatic and fiscal decisions. As one commenter mentioned, it forces Tribes and Tribal organizations to make decisions to meet the non-Federal share instead of meeting the needs of their Tribal families and communities. Many commenters indicated that their Tribal child support programs had to defer paying for required security assessments to access the Federal Parent Locator Service (FPLS), which helps in locating noncustodial parents and their assets. They also indicated that the non-Federal share requirement made their programs less efficient and effective because they had no funds or time to spend on wraparound services, employment referrals for noncustodial parents, robust outreach, intensive case

                <P>The National Association of Tribal Child Support Directors included the results of their 2022 survey in their comments. Out of the 46 respondents, the survey found that if the non-Federal share were eliminated 63 percent expected to have more time to focus on efforts to increase service quality, 50 percent would be interested in offering a fatherhood program, and 67 percent would be interested in expanding outreach.</P>
                <P>
                    Eliminating the non-Federal share will help to ensure that Tribal Nations can offer culturally appropriate and affirming child support services to their communities. Native American children in Tribal areas with child support programs are in great need of child support, especially since 53 percent of Native American children in these areas lived in single-parent families.

                     According to data from the 2015 American Community Survey, nearly one-third of Native Americans living in Tribal areas with a child support program lived below the poverty line in 2015 (that year, the poverty line for a family of three was $20,090).

                    In FY 2022, Tribal child support programs collected $51 million in child support payments, and 97 percent went to families.

                     These child support payments help to reduce the need for other supportive services such as Temporary Assistance for Needy Families (TANF). Additionally, Tribal child support programs offer unique services like non-cash support, parenting classes that reflect Tribal culture and traditions, and intensive and family-centered case management. A Tribal commenter who is receiving child support services stated, “My Tribal IV–D program treated me as a person, not just a child support case number.” The commenter also indicated that when the state was unable to locate her child's father, the Tribal child support program found him and established and enforced a child support order, which resulted in the receipt of regular child support payments. Tribal child support directors have indicated that many Tribal parents have had similar experiences and value the Tribal child support services they receive.

                    The elimination of the non-Federal share will also ensure that state child support programs continue to receive assistance from Tribal child support programs to enforce state child support orders and collect child support payments in intergovernmental cases in accordance with 45 CFR 309.120(a). For example, when a Tribal child support program receives a request for assistance from a state, they register the state child support order in Tribal court and enforce it. Then, the tribe collects the child support payment from the noncustodial parent and sends it to the state in accordance with 45 CFR 309.115(d). Without this assistance from Tribal child support programs, states are, for the most part, unable to collect child support payments in these intergovernmental cases because they lack jurisdiction to enforce their child support orders in Tribal Nations. In FY 2022, Tribal child support programs collected and sent $10 million in child support payments to states, other tribes, and countries.

                     As several commenters mentioned, Tribal governments have substantially less funds and revenue generating options than state governments. Yet the needs and disparities are greater in Tribal communities. For example, they continue to face inequalities and structural barriers that limit their opportunities, negatively impact their well-being and economic mobility, and contribute to their higher rates of poverty.

                     Instead of competing, these programs and services should collaborate to use both Federal and Tribal funds efficiently and effectively to improve the economic and social well-being of Tribal children, families, and communities. Therefore, eliminating the requirement reduces the competition for scarce resources and makes the Tribal child support program funding more equitable and obtainable for Tribal Nations. As one state commenter indicated, it helps put Tribes on more equal footing with state child support programs.

                    From the start, the Tribal child support program regulations recognized and honored Tribal sovereignty and attempted to convey flexibilities in Tribal child support programs as stated in the NPRM published in 2000 (65 FR 50805). The 2000 NPRM stated that the regulation recognizes the government-to-government relationship by supporting Tribe's right to exercise self-determination and decide whether or not to operate a Tribal child support program (65 FR 50805). Many commenters to this final rule also recognized and reiterated the importance of exercising Tribal sovereignty by operating a Tribal child support program. Child support services help Tribal communities promote parental responsibility, so children receive support from both parents even when they live in separate households. Tribes and Tribal organizations exercising their sovereignty to operate their own child support programs is, in fact, what Congress intended when it authorized funding under Personal Responsibility and Work Opportunity

                    Eliminating the non-Federal share requirement helps to achieve this and to ensure the sustainability and expansion of the program by providing the adequate and appropriate Federal financial participation. This is important because many Federal programs that assist Tribal Nations and promote Tribal sovereignty are underfunded, according to the 2018 U.S. Commission on Civil Rights report on Federal funding for Native Americans.

                <P>Nevertheless, OCSS considered whether a change in policy might negatively impact Tribal child support programs, which have structured their operations based on the existing matching requirement and determined that any potential negative impact is far outweighed by the benefit of not using scarce Tribal funds for the non-Federal share.</P>
                <P>In the NPRM published in 2000, OCSS considered several different funding approaches that controlled costs, including performance-based funding, funding based on cost per child to operate the program, capping certain costs, and state-cost based funding (65 FR 50823). OCSS engaged in extensive deliberations over the issue of funding for Tribal child support programs. After careful consideration of the advantages and disadvantages of each cost control funding approach, ultimately, the Secretary proposed open-ended funding with a Tribal match (65 FR 50823). The NPRM proposed that Tribes and Tribal organizations provide a 10 percent match during the start-up period and first 3 years of operating a Tribal child support program, with the match increasing to 20 percent thereafter (65 FR 50823). The NPRM also included a waiver provision allowing the Secretary to waive the non-Federal share for Tribes and Tribal organizations that lacked sufficient resources and met certain specific criteria (65 FR 50823).</P>
                <P>The Tribal Child Support Enforcement Program final rule was promulgated on March 30, 2004 (hereinafter final rule) and included revisions to the cost sharing provision for start-up funding and the non-Federal share waiver provisions at 45 CFR 309.130(e) (69 FR 16638 and 16646). In the final rule, OCSS indicated that it received numerous comments from Tribes objecting to the cost sharing requirement. In response, OCSS again expressed concern regarding the control of costs in the Tribal child support program, stating that “unlike other Tribal grant programs, the funding for Tribal IV–D programs is not sum certain grants,” meaning a specified and set amount of funds (69 FR 16667). OCSS further stated that the cost sharing requirement was maintained after determining “that a non-Federal share in expenditures is necessary, based on the principle that better programs and better management result when local resources are invested” (69 FR 16667). However, in response to comments, the match requirement was changed to allow 100 percent funding during the start-up period, not to exceed 2 years, and, capped at $500,000 per 45 CFR 309.130(c)(1). OCSS noted that the non-Federal match for start-up costs was eliminated in recognition that “Tribes just beginning title IV–D child support enforcement may have very limited funds for this activity” (69 FR 16646).</P>
                <P>The 2004 final rule also revised the non-Federal share waiver provisions and made them more prescriptive and restrictive (69 FR 16646). For example, OCSS noted that denied waiver requests were not subject to administrative appeal (69 FR 16646). The regulation at 45 CFR 309.130(e) permits, under certain circumstances, a temporary waiver of part or all of the non-Federal share of program expenditures. This provision includes the following two types of temporary waiver requests that a Tribe or Tribal organization may submit for consideration: “anticipated temporary waiver request” and “emergency waiver request.” Both waiver requests must be submitted in accordance with the procedures specified in 45 CFR 309.130(e)(2) through (4). These procedures require the submission of extensive information and documentation to demonstrate the temporary lack of resources and justify the waiver request.</P>
                <P>Under 45 CFR 309.130(e)(1)(i), when Tribes or Tribal organizations anticipate that they will be temporarily unable to contribute part or all of the required non-Federal share of program funding, they must submit an anticipated temporary waiver request. The anticipated waiver, due no later than 60 days before the start of the funding period, is more restrictive because untimely or incomplete requests will not be considered, in accordance with 45 CFR 309.130(e)(1)(i). Many Tribal child support programs have been denied anticipated waivers because of untimely or incomplete requests. An untimely anticipated waiver request means a Tribe submitted the request after the deadline of August 1 pursuant to 45 CFR 309.130(e)(1)(i). An incomplete anticipated waiver request means a Tribe did not include all the information required by 45 CFR 309.130(e)(2) through (4), such as portions of the Tribal budget sufficient to demonstrate the extent of the funding shortfall and uncommitted funds.</P>
                <P>Under 45 CFR 309.130(e)(1)(ii), after the start of the funding period, if an emergency situation occurs, such as a hurricane or flood, that warrants a waiver of the non-Federal share of program expenditures, Tribes or Tribal organizations may submit an emergency waiver request.</P>
                <P>
                    Although OCSS previously determined during drafting of the Tribal Child Support Enforcement Program regulations that a non-Federal match was important to ensure “better programs and better management” (69 FR 16667), it has now reconsidered that conclusion after seeing the Tribal child support program in practice during the past two decades. Based on its experience, OCSS now concludes that its oversight tools are sufficient, without the non-Federal share match, to monitor use of funds for IV–D expenditures and consider cost containment. Tribes and Tribal organizations show in their budget submissions and communications with OCSS that they are engaged in operating successful programs and using Federal funds properly, efficiently, and effectively, in accordance with 45 CFR 309.60(b). A non-Federal share is also not necessary to ensure Tribal investment in the program. Tribes and Tribal organizations are inherently invested in operating a child support program because they can exercise their Tribal sovereignty and incorporate their Tribal traditions and customs. Most importantly, they are invested in the Tribal members who staff their programs and the Tribal families and children who benefit from child support services. They will continue to provide Tribal resources, such as Tribal 
                    <PRTPAGE P="9788"/>
                    buildings and courts, to ensure their programs are successful and efficient.
                </P>
                <P>The Tribal child support program regulations provide OCSS with sufficient authority to control costs and monitor compliance without the non-Federal share requirement. The primary method for evaluating and ensuring allowable and appropriate costs is through the budget submission, review, and approval process. The regulation at 45 CFR 309.15(c) requires Tribal child support programs to submit a budget to receive Title IV–D funding to administer their child support programs. Budgets must include the detailed information specified in 45 CFR 309.130(b) and OCSS guidance, such as quarterly estimate of expenditures, narrative justification for each cost category, and copies of contracts (see Tribal Child Support Budget Toolbox and OCSS PIQT–21–01). OCSS and Office of Grants Management (OGM) review Tribal budget submissions for compliance with 45 CFR parts 309, 310, and 75 and other applicable Federal laws. During the review of Tribal budgets, OCSS and OGM examine the estimates of program expenditures, determine whether the budget narratives and documentation justify costs, and approve allowable costs charged to the Title IV–D grant. OCSS reviews the entire budget in detail to ensure the costs are reasonable and necessary given the caseload size and other demographic and geographic factors. OCSS compares contract costs to industry standards and similar contracts from other child support programs. For questionable costs, OCSS works with the Tribe to obtain additional information or revise or remove those costs when warranted. For example, OCSS determined that a Tribe's contract costs for information technology development were higher than the industry standard and worked with the Tribe to secure a reduction in the costs before approving the contract.</P>
                <P>OCSS must approve a Tribe's budget before OGM issues a notice of grant award, which provides OCSS with direct oversight over Tribal expenditures before Tribal child support programs drawdown and use Title IV–D funds at the start of the fiscal year. After OCSS approves a Tribe's budget, a Tribe may request additional funds by submitting the information specified in 45 CFR 309.130(f)(1). If the increase in funds impacts the Tribal IV–D plan, the Tribe must also submit a plan amendment in accordance with 45 CFR 309.130(f)(2). A Tribe must provide the required information and documentation and the costs must comply with the Federal regulations before OCSS approves the request for an increase in funds. This ensures that increases in approved Tribal budgets are reasonable, necessary, allowable, and allocable. Additionally, OCSS uses a variety of methods to provide technical assistance and assess needs so that Tribal child support programs comply with the program regulations, uniform grant requirements, and cost principles. These methods include conducting training, national webinars, conference workshops, regional meetings, and site visits. As a result, the overall Tribal child support program expenditures of existing Tribes are not expected to rise substantially beyond normal cost increases due to factors like inflation, filling vacancies, or upgrading equipment and systems.</P>
                <P>Even with the elimination of the non-Federal share, OCSS does not expect that every federally recognized Tribe or Tribal organization will request funding to operate a Tribal child support program, meaning that OCSS expects only a modest and gradual increase in program expenditures. Prospective Tribes and Tribal organizations may not have the required administrative capacity or infrastructure to operate a child support program. For example, they may not have 100 children under the age of majority, as referenced in 45 CFR 309.10(a). Although they may request a waiver of this requirement (45 CFR 309.10(c)), the waiver must demonstrate that their prospective Tribal child support program will be cost effective (45 CFR 309.10(c)(1)(iii)). Additionally, prospective Tribes and Tribal organizations may not want to comply with the extensive requirements and procedures required to receive funding (45 CFR 309.65). A Tribal court can hear child support cases without the Tribe administering a child support program. Administering a Tribal child support program and working with parents on such a vulnerable and sensitive subject is complex and demanding. As previously mentioned, instead of operating their own Tribal child support program, they may jointly operate a program or may receive child support services from an existing Tribal child support program.</P>
                <P>As a policy alternative to eliminating the non-Federal share, OCSS considered revising the non-Federal share waiver requirements to make waivers easier to request and receive. In fact, the non-Federal share waiver requirements proposed in the 2000 NPRM were less restrictive and burdensome than the requirements in the 2004 final rule under 45 CFR 309.130(e) (65 FR 50837). Only one commenter suggested this policy alternative. Reducing the burden and criteria for requesting non-Federal share waivers does not change the fact that they are temporary and must be requested each time a Tribe needs one. The underlying issues that make meeting the non-Federal share difficult or impossible for Tribes and Tribal organizations are persistent, intractable, and systemic such as high rates of unemployment, little or no economic development, or lack of or a decline in revenue. As one commenter pointed out, Tribal communities have been historically underserved, marginalized, or subject to discrimination or systemic disadvantage. These issues not only hinder current Tribal child support programs from meeting the non-Federal share and potentially shutting down, but they also prevent prospective Tribes from even applying for funding. Therefore, OCSS does not think revising the non-Federal share waiver requirements would increase Tribal participation or reduce the risks of program closures as much as eliminating the requirement entirely. Nor would it reduce the administrative burden associated with tracking and reporting on non-Federal share contributions and submitting waiver requests. Most importantly, revising the non-Federal share waiver provision recognizes the need to implement the 2000 NPRM directive for the Secretary to revise the regulations when the 80/20 match rate is disruptive to the program and imposes hardship to Tribes (65 FR 50823). Accordingly, the time has come to revise the regulation. The overwhelming majority of commenters agreed with this decision.</P>
                <P>In 1996, Congress was compelled to pass PRWORA and authorize direct funding of Tribes and Tribal organizations for operating child support programs. And now, OCSS issues this final rule that eliminates the non-Federal share requirement, helping to ensure that new Tribal child support programs are established, and current ones continue to operate and thrive, as Congress intended. As a result, more Tribal communities will receive child support services that reflect and affirm their Tribal cultures and traditions, increase family economic well-being, and help lift Tribal families out of poverty.</P>

                    <PRTPAGE P="9789"/>
                    ended June 20, 2023. OCSS received 51 sets of comments from 48 entities as follows: 28 Tribes, 5 Tribal child support programs, 5 states, 5 organizations, and 5 individuals. Three Tribes submitted 2 sets of comments. Comments were posted on

                </P>
                <P>Overwhelmingly, the comments received on the NPRM supported the elimination of the non-Federal share requirement for Tribal child support programs. Several commenters indicated that they had no objections to the regulatory revisions, as discussed below, resulting from the elimination of the non-Federal share. Only one comment disagreed with the elimination and recommended allocating funds by the size of the Tribal child support program or revising the non-Federal share waiver provision instead.</P>
                <HD SOURCE="HD2">Section 309.15 What is a Tribal IV–D program application?</HD>
                <P>In § 309.15(a)(2)(iii), OCSS proposed removing the language “; and either:” at the end of that provision and inserting a period in its place. Section 309.15(a)(2)(iv) requires the initial application for funding to include a statement that the Tribe or Tribal organization has or will have the non-Federal share of program expenditures available. Section 309.15(a)(2)(v) permits a request for a waiver of the non-Federal share in accordance with § 309.130(e). OCSS proposed removing § 309.15(a)(2)(iv) and (v) due to the elimination of the non-Federal share. There were no objections to the proposed regulatory amendments.</P>
                <HD SOURCE="HD2">Section 309.45 When and how may a Tribe or Tribal organization request reconsideration of a disapproval action?</HD>
                <P>Section 309.45(g) indicates that disapproval of start-up funding, a request for waiver of the 100-child rule, and a request for waiver of the non-Federal Tribal share is not subject to administrative appeal. OCSS proposed amending § 309.45(g) by removing “, and a request for waiver of the non-Federal Tribal share.” Revised paragraph (g) will read as follows: “Disapproval of start-up funding and a request for waiver of the 100-child rule is not subject to administrative appeal.” There were no objections to the proposed regulatory amendments.</P>
                <HD SOURCE="HD2">Section 309.75 What administrative and management procedures must a Tribe or Tribal organization include in a Tribal IV–D plan?</HD>
                <P>Section 309.75(e) describes the requirements for a Tribe and Tribal organization that intends to charge an application fee or recover costs in excess of the fee. Collected fees and recovered costs are considered program income and deducted from total allowable costs in accordance with 45 CFR 309.75(e)(4) and 75.307(e)(1). Due to the proposed elimination of the non-Federal share requirement, we proposed revising § 309.75(e) and modified the proposed language in the NPRM, requiring Tribal child support programs to provide that charging fees and recovering costs will not be permitted. We also proposed removing paragraphs (e)(1) through (4). There were no objections to the proposed regulatory amendments.</P>
                <HD SOURCE="HD2">Section 309.85 What records must a Tribe or Tribal organization agree to maintain in a Tribal IV–D plan?</HD>
                <P>Section 309.85(a)(6) requires a Tribe or Tribal organization to maintain records on any fees charged and collected, if applicable. As previously stated, collected fees and recovered costs are considered program income and deducted from total allowable costs in accordance with 45 CFR 309.75(e)(4) and 75.307(e)(1). Due to the proposed elimination of the non-Federal share requirement, we proposed removing § 309.85(a)(6) and redesignating § 309.85(a)(7) to § 309.85(a)(6). There were no objections to the proposed regulatory amendments.</P>

                <P>In § 309.130(b)(2)(iii), we proposed removing the language “and for funding under § 309.65(a) either:” at the end of that provision and replacing it with a period. Section 309.130(b)(2)(iv) requires the annual Tribal budget submissions to include a statement certifying that the Tribe or Tribal organization has or will have the non-Federal share of program expenditures. Section 309.130(b)(2)(v) permits a request for a waiver of the non-Federal share in accordance with paragraph (e) of the section. We proposed removing § 309.130(b)(2)(iv) and (v) due to the elimination of the non-Federal share requirement.</P>
                <P>Section 309.130(c) describes the Federal share of program expenditures for start-up funding and for initial and ongoing grant funding to administer a Tribal child support program. We proposed amending § 309.130(c)(2) by removing “during a 3-year period,” replacing “90” with “100”, and adding “and thereafter” following “made during that period.” We proposed amending § 309.130(c)(3) by removing § 309.130(c)(3)(i), redesignating paragraph (c)(3)(ii) to paragraph (c)(3), and replacing “90” with “100”. We proposed these revisions to indicate that the Federal share of program expenditures will be 100 percent due to the elimination of the non-Federal share requirement.</P>
                <P>Section 309.130(d) describes the requirements for the non-Federal share of program expenditures. We proposed removing § 309.130(d) due to the elimination of the non-Federal share requirement.</P>
                <P>Section 309.130(e) describes the requirements for permitting a temporary waiver of part or all of the non-Federal share of program expenditures. We proposed removing § 309.130(e) due to the elimination of the non-Federal share requirement.</P>
                <P>Section 309.130(f) describes the requirements for requesting increases in the approved Tribal budget and § 309.130(f)(3) addresses how budget increases impact the non-Federal share. We proposed redesignating § 309.130(f) to § 309.130(d) and removing § 309.130(f)(3).</P>
                <P>Section 309.130(g) describes how to obtain Federal funds and § 309.130(h) requires compliance with the uniform administrative requirements and cost principles. We proposed redesignating § 309.130(g) and (h) to § 309.130(e) and (f), respectively.</P>
                <P>The overwhelming majority of comments supported the elimination of the non-Federal share requirement.

After further consideration, OCSS has decided it is necessary to maintain the Model Tribal Systems (MTS) requirements described in § 310.10(c) because a Tribal child support program may collect fees to assist a state child support program in an intergovernmental case. If so, they would need to record and report any fees collected along with expenditure information as per § 310.10(c).

                     The majority of commenters indicated that they had no objections to the regulatory revisions proposed in 45 CFR 309.15, 309.45, 309.75, 309.85, 309.155, 309.170, and 310.20.

                    <E T="03">Response 1:</E>
                     Based on the overwhelming support for the elimination of the non-Federal share of program expenditure requirement for Tribal child support programs, including the 90/10 and 80/20 cost sharing rates, OCSS agrees that the relief should be provided.
                </P>
                <P>For the reasons described in the proposed rule and above, OCSS revises 45 CFR 309.15, 309.45, 309.75, 309.83, 309.155, 309.170, and 310.20 as proposed.</P>

                    <E T="03">Comment 2:</E>
                     Overwhelmingly, Tribes, Tribal child support programs, states, organizations, and individuals who submitted comments were unequivocal in their support of the proposed elimination of the non-Federal share requirement.
                </P>
                <P>Most commenters indicated that the non-Federal share limits growth, causes disruptions, creates instability, and imposes hardships for Tribal child support programs.</P>
                <P>Many Tribal commenters stated that meeting the non-Federal share forced their Tribal child support program to reduce services, cut travel and training, and forgo hiring staff, modernizing, digitizing, accessing FPLS, and participating in the Federal Tax Refund Offset Program (FTRO). Several Tribal commenters also indicated that these forced cuts and reductions made their programs less efficient and effective. For example, one Tribal commenter indicated that their program was unable to afford their non-Federal share to access enforcement remedies like FPLS and FTRO to locate noncustodial parents and to offset Federal tax returns for overdue support.</P>
                <P>Many commenters indicated that Tribes had limited resources. Several Tribal commenters described how meeting the non-Federal share diverted their limited Tribal funds from essential self-governance services and functions for the elderly, youth, Tribal courts, public safety, natural resources, natural disasters, and crisis mitigation like the opioid crisis and coronavirus disease pandemic. Some Tribal commenters also stated that it forced Tribal programs to compete for those limited funds and make difficult decisions about how to allocate resources to address the needs and issues of Tribal members and which programs to underfund. Two commenters indicated how Tribal governments do not have taxing authorities like state governments.</P>
                <P>Some Tribal commenters stated that finding, tracking, calculating, and documenting non-Federal share contributions was time consuming and that their efforts could be better used on providing needed child support services to families, such as parenting classes and fatherhood programs. Some Tribal commenters also indicated that the non-Federal share waiver requirements were burdensome and impossible to meet. And two Tribal commenters stated that Congress did not impose the non-Federal share requirement in the authorizing legislation.</P>
                <P>One Tribal commenter indicated that they may have to shut down their Tribal child support program if OCSS does not eliminate the non-Federal share requirement. And two commenters mentioned how one Tribe had to close their program because of the difficulty with providing the non-Federal share.</P>
                <P>Many commenters indicated that the elimination of non-Federal share would be beneficial for Tribal child support programs. Several commenters specified that they would increase child support services, update their systems, and fill vacancies. Several commenters also stated that the elimination would help to ensure that existing programs continue operating and new ones are established, creating stability and growth. Additionally, several commenters emphasized the importance of Tribes and Tribal organizations exercising their Tribal sovereignty by administering a child support program.</P>
                <P>One commenter stated that the elimination promotes equity by removing a substantial financial burden for Tribal communities that have been historically underserved, marginalized, or subject to discrimination or systemic disadvantage. Two commenters indicated that it honors the trust relationship the Federal Government has with Tribal Nations. And another two commenters stated that it would reduce bureaucratic barriers faced by Tribes and Tribal organizations.</P>
                <P>One commenter agreed that OCSS still has sufficient oversight and cost containment tools without the non-Federal share requirement. Another commenter indicated that many Tribes and Tribal organizations will continue to invest in their programs by contributing Tribal facilities and using Tribal members as staff. Many commenters indicated how Tribes and Tribal organizations are invested in their children, helping noncustodial and custodial parents support them financially and emotionally.</P>
                <P>A few Tribal commenters indicated that the elimination demonstrates that OCSS is listening to Tribes and Tribal organizations.</P>
                <P>Many commenters expressed the need for child support services in Tribal communities to help lift Tribal families and children out of poverty.</P>
                <P>
                    <E T="03">Response 2:</E>
                     Based on the overwhelming support for the proposed elimination of the non-Federal share requirement, for the reasons described in the NPRM and by the majority of commenters, OCSS agrees that the non-Federal share requirement should be eliminated for Tribal child support programs.
                </P>

                    <E T="03">Comment 3:</E>
                     One individual opposed the elimination of the non-Federal share requirement without replacing with another cost containment mechanism. The commenter thought OCSS could not reasonably expect to apply the level of oversight or impartiality to fiscally 
                    <PRTPAGE P="9791"/>
                    manage a program where an unlimited amount of money can be requested without financial participation by grantees. The commenter indicated that cost sharing ensures a grantee considers cost-to-benefit proposition and that the principle has never been questioned for states and is a solid principle for Tribes. In lieu of cost sharing, the commenter recommended allocating funds by the size of the Tribal program based upon historical caseload data. The commenter also recommended revising the non-Federal share waiver provision. The commenter indicated that Tribes are not all in the same financial position and some have limited resources while others are thriving.

                    <E T="03">Response 3:</E>
                     OCSS disagrees. As discussed previously, the Tribal child support program regulations provide OCSS with sufficient authority to control costs and monitor compliance without the non-Federal share requirement. Unlike state child support programs, Tribal child support programs must submit a budget to receive Title IV–D funding in accordance with 45 CFR 309.15(c). Budgets must include the detailed information specified in 45 CFR 309.130(b) and OCSS guidance, such as quarterly estimate of expenditures, narrative justification for each cost category, and copies of contracts (see Tribal Child Support Budget Toolbox and OCSS PIQT–21–01). OCSS and OGM review Tribal budget submissions for compliance with 45 CFR parts 309, 310, and 75 and other applicable Federal laws. During the review of Tribal budgets, OCSS and OGM examine the estimates of program expenditures, and determine whether the budget narratives and documentation justify costs. Many factors impact a Tribe's caseload. For example, some Tribal child support programs receive cases transferred from a state child support program, others do not and must conduct intensive outreach to get parents to apply for services, a few Tribal child support programs receive referrals from the Tribal TANF programs, and at least one Tribal child support program provides services to other Tribes. Several Tribal child support programs have parents who do not live locally and reaching them is costly. As indicated by the feedback from Tribes and Tribal organizations, meeting the non-Federal share has limited their ability of conduct outreach to increase their caseloads. Therefore, using historical data is problematic and may not be a valid predictor for prospective Tribes and Tribal organizations since they have unique characteristics, histories, and relationships with their states.
                </P>
                <P>Additionally, OCSS considered but decided against capping certain costs for Tribal child support programs in the 2000 NPRM (65 FR 50823). OCSS also disagrees with that option now. Capping costs limits Tribes and Tribal organizations to self-govern, grow their program as they determine, and innovate to meet the evolving needs and circumstances of Tribal parents and children.</P>

                     Although commenters indicated that they had no objection to the regulatory revisions proposed in § 310.10, OCSS has decided not to revise 45 CFR 310.10 as originally proposed in the Notice of Proposed Rulemaking. Specifically, OCSS has determined, as noted above, it is necessary to maintain the Model Tribal Systems (MTS) requirements described in § 310.10(c) because a Tribal child support program may collect fees to assist a state child support program in an intergovernmental case. If so, they would need to record and report any fees collected along with expenditure information as per § 310.10(c). And, because we are retaining § 310.10(c), we no longer need to redesignate the other paragraphs.

                <P>Under the Paperwork Reduction Act (Pub. L. 104–13), all Departments are required to submit to the Office of Management and Budget (OMB) for review and approval any reporting or recordkeeping requirements inherent in a proposed or final rule. For this final rule, Tribal child support programs that charge fees and recover costs must submit a plan amendment, providing that charging fees and recovering costs will not be permitted. Only three Tribal programs report data on the collection of fees and recovered costs. The description and total estimated burden on the “Tribal Child Support Enforcement Direct Funding Request” (OMB #0907–0218) is described in the chart below.</P>

                <P>The Secretary certifies that, under 5 U.S.C. 605(b), as enacted by the Regulatory Flexibility Act (Pub. L. 96–354), this rule will not result in a significant impact on a substantial number of small entities. The primary impact is on Tribal governments. Tribal governments are not considered small entities under the Regulatory Flexibility Act.</P>
                <HD SOURCE="HD2">Congressional Review</HD>
                <P>
                    The Congressional Review Act (CRA) allows Congress to review major rules issued by Federal agencies before the rules take effect (see 5 U.S.C. 801(a)). The CRA defines a “major rule” as one that has resulted, or is likely to result, in (1) an annual effect on the economy of $100 million or more; (2) a major increase in costs or prices for consumers; individual industries; Federal, State, or local government agencies; or geographic regions; or (3) significant adverse effects on competition, employment, investment, productivity, or innovation, or on the ability of United States-based enterprises to compete with foreign based enterprises in domestic and export markets (see 5 U.S.C. Chapter 8). Based on our estimates of the impact of this rule, the Office of Information and Regulatory Affairs (OIRA) in the Office of Management and Budget (OMB) has designated this rule as `not major' under the CRA.

                <HD SOURCE="HD3">Executive Orders 12866, 13563, and 14094</HD>
                <P>Executive Orders 12866, as amended by Executive Order 14094, and 13563 direct agencies to assess all costs and benefits of available regulatory alternatives and, if regulation is necessary, to select regulatory approaches that maximize net benefits (including potential economic, environmental, public health and safety effects, distributive impacts, and equity). Executive Order 13563 emphasizes the importance of quantifying both costs and benefits, of reducing costs, of harmonizing rules, and of promoting flexibility. This rule meets the standards of Executive Order 12866, as amended by Executive Order 14094, and Executive Order 13563 because it creates equity, promotes predictability, and reduces burdens and hardships for Tribal child support programs. The non-Federal share requirement limits growth, causes disruptions, and creates instability. Eliminating it encourages expansion of services and enforcement remedies, removes a financial barrier for prospective Tribes and Tribal organizations, prevents closure of existing Tribal child support programs, and provides a permanent solution to longstanding problems. This will ensure Tribal families receive child support services that reflect and affirm their cultures and traditions and that promote parental responsibility and increase disposable family income and financial stability.</P>
                <P>Executive Order 12866, as reaffirmed by E.O. 13563 and E.O. 14094, provides that OIRA at OMB will review all significant rules. Section 3(f) of E.O. 12866, as modified by 14094, defines “a significant regulatory action” as an action that is likely to result in a rule (1) having an annual effect on the economy of $200 million or more in any 1 year, or adversely and materially affecting a sector of the economy, productivity, competition, jobs, the environment, public health or safety, or State, local, and Tribal governments or communities; (2) creating serious inconsistency or otherwise interfering with an action taken or planned by another agency; (3) materially altering the budgetary impacts of entitlements, grants, user fees, or loan programs or the rights and obligations of recipients thereof; or (4) raising legal or policy issues for which centralized review would meaningfully further the President's priorities, or the principles set forth in the Executive order. OIRA has determined that this final rule is significant, and it was accordingly reviewed by OMB.</P>
                <P>Based upon the increase in program expenditures from existing Tribal child support programs and the modest growth of new programs due to the elimination of the non-Federal share, we anticipate that the costs associated with this rule will be the following: FY 2025 $17.2M; FY 2026 $19M; FY 2027 $26.4M; FY 2028 34.3M; and FY 2029 $42.6M.</P>
                <HD SOURCE="HD2">Unfunded Mandates Reform Act of 1995</HD>
                <P>The Unfunded Mandates Reform Act of 1995 (Pub. L. 104–4) requires agencies to prepare an assessment of anticipated costs and benefits before issuing any rule that may result in an annual expenditure by state, local, and Tribal governments, in the aggregate, or by the private sector, of $100 million or more (adjusted annually for inflation). That threshold level is currently approximately $164 million. This rule does not impose any mandates on State, local, or Tribal governments, or the private sector, that will result in an annual expenditure of $164 million or more.</P>
                <HD SOURCE="HD2">Assessment of Federal Regulations and Policies on Families</HD>
                <P>Section 654 of the Treasury and General Government Appropriations Act of 1999 requires Federal agencies to determine whether a proposed policy or regulation may affect family well-being. If the agency's determination is affirmative, then the agency must prepare an impact assessment addressing seven criteria specified in the law. We certify that we have assessed this proposed rule's impact on the well-being of families. The purpose of the Tribal child support program is to strengthen the financial and social stability of families. This rule eliminates the burden and hardships imposed by the non-Federal share requirement for Tribal child support programs, which limits growth, causes disruptions, and creates instability. Eliminating it encourages expansion of services and enforcement remedies, removes a financial barrier for prospective Tribes and Tribal organizations, and prevents closure of existing Tribal child support programs. The proposed rule will have a positive effect on family well-being. It will ensure Tribal families receive child support services that reflect and affirm their cultures and traditions and that promote parental responsibility and increase disposable family income and financial stability.</P>
                <HD SOURCE="HD2">Executive Order 13132</HD>
                <P>Executive Order 13132 prohibits an agency from publishing any rule that has federalism implications if the rule either imposes substantial direct compliance costs on State and local governments and is not required by statute, or the rule preempts state law, unless the agency meets the consultation and funding requirements of section 6 of the Executive order. This rule does not have federalism impact as defined in the Executive order.</P>

                <P>Regulations governing the summer flounder fishery are found in 50 CFR 648.100 through 648.111. These regulations require annual specification of a commercial quota that is apportioned among the coastal states from Maine through North Carolina.

                    another. Two or more states, under mutual agreement and with the concurrence of the NMFS Greater Atlantic Regional Administrator, can transfer or combine summer flounder commercial quota under § 648.102(c)(2). The Regional Administrator is required to consider three criteria in the evaluation of requests for quota transfers or combinations: (1) the transfers or combinations would not preclude the overall annual quota from being fully harvested; (2) the transfers address an unforeseen variation or contingency in the fishery; and (3) the transfers are consistent with the objectives of the FMP and the Magnuson-Stevens Fishery Conservation and Management Act (Magnuson-Stevens Act). The Regional Administrator has determined these three criteria have been met for the transfer approved in this notification.
                </P>
                <P>North Carolina is transferring 14,280 pounds (lb; 6,477 kilograms (kg)) to Virginia through a mutual agreement between the states. This transfer was requested to repay landings made by an out-of-state permitted vessel under a safe harbor agreement. The revised summer flounder quotas for 2024 are North Carolina, 2,398,163 lb (1,087,788 kg), and Virginia, 1,887,987 lb (856,376 kg).</P>

                    <P>
                        The FAA proposes to adopt a new airworthiness directive (AD) for all Airbus SAS Model A330–200, A330–200 Freighter, A330–800, and A330–900 series airplanes; Model A330–301, –302, –303, –323, –342, and –343
                        <E T="03"> airplanes; and Model A340–312 and –313 airplanes.</E>
                         This proposed AD was prompted by reports of quality non-conformity on main landing gear (MLG) axles where the high velocity oxygen-fuel (HVOF) coating on the bearing journal runout areas had a coating that was thicker than allowable limits. This proposed AD would require repetitive inspections of the affected parts (MLG axles) for any discrepancy, corrective actions, and eventual replacement of affected parts, and would prohibit the installation of affected parts, as specified in a European Union Aviation Safety Agency (EASA) AD, which is proposed for incorporation by reference (IBR). The FAA is proposing this AD to address the unsafe condition on these products.

                    EASA, which is the Technical Agent for the Member States of the European Union, has issued EASA AD 2023–0167, dated August 30, 2023 (EASA AD 2023–0167) (also referred to as the MCAI), to correct an unsafe condition for all Airbus SAS Model A330–200, A330–200 Freighter, A330–800, and A330–900 series airplanes; Model A330–301, –302, –303, –323, –342, –343, and –743L airplanes; and Model A340–312 and –313 airplanes. Model A330–743L airplanes are not certificated by the FAA and are not included on the U.S. type certificate data sheet; this proposed AD therefore does not include those airplanes in the applicability. The MCAI states there are reports of quality non-

                    conformity on MLG axles where the HVOF coating on the bearing journal runout areas had a coating thicker than allowable limits. This over-thickness could lead to damage, cracking, or spalling of the protective coating, which could expose the base material and allow corrosion to develop. This condition, if not detected and corrected, could lead to a MLG axle failure, possibly resulting in a MLG collapse, with consequent damage to the airplane and injury to occupants.

                <P>This proposed AD would require accomplishing the actions specified in EASA AD 2023–0167 described previously, except for any differences identified as exceptions in the regulatory text of this proposed AD.</P>
                <HD SOURCE="HD1">Explanation of Required Compliance Information</HD>
                <P>
                    In the FAA's ongoing efforts to improve the efficiency of the AD process, the FAA developed a process to use some civil aviation authority (CAA) ADs as the primary source of information for compliance with requirements for corresponding FAA ADs. The FAA has been coordinating this process with manufacturers and CAAs. As a result, the FAA proposes to incorporate EASA AD 2023–0167 by reference in the FAA final rule. This proposed AD would, therefore, require compliance with EASA AD 2023–0167 in its entirety through that incorporation, except for any differences identified as exceptions in the regulatory text of this proposed AD. Using common terms that are the same as the heading of a particular section in EASA AD 2023–0167 does not mean that operators need comply only with that section. For example, where the AD requirement refers to “all required actions and compliance times,” compliance with this AD requirement is not limited to the section titled “Required Action(s) and Compliance Time(s)” in EASA AD 2023–0167. Service information required by EASA AD 2023–0167 for compliance will be available at 
                    <E T="03">regulations.gov</E>
                     under Docket No. FAA–2024–0223 after the FAA final rule is published.

                <P>Title 49 of the United States Code specifies the FAA's authority to issue rules on aviation safety. Subtitle I, section 106, describes the authority of the FAA Administrator. Subtitle VII: Aviation Programs, describes in more detail the scope of the Agency's authority.</P>
                <P>The FAA is issuing this rulemaking under the authority described in Subtitle VII, Part A, Subpart III, Section 44701: General requirements. Under that section, Congress charges the FAA with promoting safe flight of civil aircraft in air commerce by prescribing regulations for practices, methods, and procedures the Administrator finds necessary for safety in air commerce. This regulation is within the scope of that authority because it addresses an unsafe condition that is likely to exist or develop on products identified in this rulemaking action.</P>
                <HD SOURCE="HD1">Regulatory Findings</HD>
                <P>The FAA determined that this proposed AD would not have federalism implications under Executive Order 13132. This proposed AD would not have a substantial direct effect on the States, on the relationship between the national Government and the States, or on the distribution of power and responsibilities among the various levels of government.</P>
                <P>For the reasons discussed above, I certify this proposed regulation:</P>
                <P>(1) Is not a “significant regulatory action” under Executive Order 12866,</P>
                <P>(2) Would not affect intrastate aviation in Alaska, and</P>
                <P>(3) Would not have a significant economic impact, positive or negative, on a substantial number of small entities under the criteria of the Regulatory Flexibility Act.</P>

                    <P>The FAA proposes to adopt a new airworthiness directive (AD) for all Airbus Canada Limited Partnership Model BD–500–1A10 and BD–500–1A11 airplanes. This proposed AD was prompted by a design review of aircraft structural and stress reports that resulted in a revision of operational loads for some aircraft flight phases. This proposed AD would require using a certain version of the aircraft structural repair manual (ASRP) and a review and disposition of repairs based on previous versions, as specified in a Transport Canada AD, which is proposed for incorporation by reference (IBR). The FAA is proposing this AD to address the unsafe condition on these products.</P>

                <P>
                    Transport Canada, which is the aviation authority for Canada, has issued Transport Canada AD CF–2023–
                    <PRTPAGE P="9799"/>
                    37, dated May 30, 2023 (Transport Canada AD CF–2023–37) (also referred to as the MCAI), to correct an unsafe condition for all Airbus Canada Limited Partnership Model BD–500–1A10 and BD–500–1A11 airplanes. The MCAI states that a design review of aircraft structural and stress reports has resulted in a revision of operational loads for some aircraft flight phases, affecting certain aircraft sections. As a result, repairs and damage assessments accomplished on aircraft to date may have exceeded the available structural margins and require review to ensure they comply with the revised stress data for the affected sections. This AD mandates that ASRP 136.01 or later approved versions, or Airbus Canada source data approved at the time of the disposition, is to be used for any new structural assessments, repairs and dispositions for all model BD–500–1A10 and model BD–500–1A11 airplanes. Additionally, this AD mandates the review and disposition of all repairs and damage assessments for affected structure and prohibits use of previously authorized repairs as source data to generate new repairs for affected structure for model BD–500–1A10 airplanes.
                </P>
                <P>There is an ongoing review of affected areas for model BD–500–1A11 airplanes which may result in additional corrective action for assessment and disposition of existing and new structural repairs and damage assessments.</P>
                <P>The FAA is proposing this AD to address in-service repairs in some structural areas that require verification, and possibly further repair, because, if not addressed, they can cause negative margins for the load envelopes.</P>
                <P>
                    You may examine the MCAI in the AD docket at 
                    <E T="03">regulations.gov</E>

                    Transport Canada AD CF–2023–37 specifies procedures for doing a verification/record check of previous aircraft damage and repairs and determining if previous repairs require further action based on revised limits and damage assessments. Transport Canada AD CF–2023–37 further prohibits the use of ASRPs prior to 136.01 and certain repair engineering orders, and instead mandates, for damage assessment, the use of ASRP 136.01 or later, or Airbus Canada source data approved as of the effective date of the AD. This material is reasonably available because the interested parties have access to it through their normal course of business or by the means identified in

                <P>This product has been approved by the aviation authority of another country and is approved for operation in the United States. Pursuant to the FAA's bilateral agreement with this State of Design Authority, it has notified the FAA of the unsafe condition described in the MCAI referenced above. The FAA is issuing this NPRM after determining that the unsafe condition described previously is likely to exist or develop in other products of the same type design.</P>
                <HD SOURCE="HD1">Proposed AD Requirements in This NPRM</HD>
                <P>This proposed AD would require accomplishing the actions specified in Transport Canada AD CF–2023–37 described previously, except for any differences identified as exceptions in the regulatory text of this proposed AD.</P>
                <HD SOURCE="HD1">Explanation of Required Compliance Information</HD>
                <P>
                    In the FAA's ongoing efforts to improve the efficiency of the AD process, the FAA developed a process to use some civil aviation authority (CAA) ADs as the primary source of information for compliance with requirements for corresponding FAA ADs. The FAA has been coordinating this process with manufacturers and CAAs. As a result, the FAA proposes to incorporate Transport Canada AD CF–2023–37 by reference in the FAA final rule. This proposed AD would, therefore, require compliance with Transport Canada AD CF–2023–37 in its entirety through that incorporation, except for any differences identified as exceptions in the regulatory text of this proposed AD. Service information required by Transport Canada AD CF–2023–37 for compliance will be available at 
                    <E T="03">regulations.gov</E>
                     under Docket No. FAA–2024–0225 after the FAA final rule is published.

                <P>Title 49 of the United States Code specifies the FAA's authority to issue rules on aviation safety. Subtitle I, section 106, describes the authority of the FAA Administrator. Subtitle VII: Aviation Programs, describes in more detail the scope of the Agency's authority.</P>
                <P>The FAA is issuing this rulemaking under the authority described in Subtitle VII, Part A, Subpart III, Section 44701: General requirements. Under that section, Congress charges the FAA with promoting safe flight of civil aircraft in air commerce by prescribing regulations for practices, methods, and procedures the Administrator finds necessary for safety in air commerce. This regulation is within the scope of that authority because it addresses an unsafe condition that is likely to exist or develop on products identified in this rulemaking action.</P>
                <HD SOURCE="HD1">Regulatory Findings</HD>
                <P>The FAA determined that this proposed AD would not have federalism implications under Executive Order 13132. This proposed AD would not have a substantial direct effect on the States, on the relationship between the national Government and the States, or on the distribution of power and responsibilities among the various levels of government.</P>

                        The Coast Guard is proposing to establish a safety zone for certain waters of the Biscayne Bay. This action is necessary to provide for the safety of life on these navigable waters near Homestead, FL, during a recurring military exercises that would be enforced approximately 8–12 times per year. The exercises will include military aircraft and watercraft that may pose a

                        danger to the public. This proposed rulemaking would prohibit persons and vessels from being in the safety zone unless authorized by the Captain of the Port Sector Miami or a designated representative. We invite your comments on this proposed rulemaking.

                <HD SOURCE="HD1">II. Background, Purpose, and Legal Basis</HD>
                <P>On February 6, 2023, the U.S. Special Operations Command South (SOCSO) notified the Coast Guard that it would be conducting recurring military training exercises 8–12 times per year. The training exercises would take place within the Biscayne Bay Northeast of Turkey Point Power Plant. The Captain of the Port Sector Miami (COTP) has determined that potential hazards associated with the military training exercises would be a safety concern for persons and vessels within a 1,000-yard radius of the center point of the exercises. The exercises would include military aircraft and watercraft operating in active military scenarios. The actions undertaken in these exercises may pose a danger to the public.</P>
                <P>The purpose of this rulemaking is to ensure the safety of vessels and the navigable waters within a 1,000-yard radius of the military training exercises before, during, and after the military training exercises. The Coast Guard is proposing this rulemaking under authority in 46 U.S.C. 70034.</P>
                <HD SOURCE="HD1">III. Discussion of Proposed Rule</HD>
                <P>The COTP is proposing to establish a safety zone that would be enforced 8–12 times per year. The safety zone would cover all navigable waters within a 1,000-yard radius of the center point at N 25′28.506 W 80′13.842 in the Biscayne Bay located approximately 1,000 yards Northeast of the Turkey Point Power Plant in Homestead, FL. The duration of the zone would be identified prior to each military training exercise to ensure the safety of persons and vessels, and navigable waters before, during, and after the scheduled times for the exercise. No person or vessel would be permitted to enter the safety zone without obtaining permission from the COTP or a designated representative.</P>
                <P>Members of the public would be notified that the safety zone is being enforced by the presence of military helicopter with the insignia of the U.S. Army, the U.S. Air Force, the U.S. Navy, or the U.S. Marine Corps, in the direct vicinity of the safety zone. Leading up to its enforcement the Coast Guard will publish a Notice of Enforcement (NOE) in addition to a Marine Safety Information Bulletin (MSIB) and a Broadcast Notice to Mariners (BNM).</P>
                <P>The regulatory text we are proposing appears at the end of this document.</P>
                <HD SOURCE="HD1">IV. Regulatory Analyses</HD>
                <P>We developed this proposed rule after considering numerous statutes and Executive orders related to rulemaking. Below we summarize our analyses based on a number of these statutes and Executive orders, and we discuss First Amendment rights of protestors.</P>
                <HD SOURCE="HD2">A. Regulatory Planning and Review</HD>
                <P>Executive Orders 12866 and 13563 direct agencies to assess the costs and benefits of available regulatory alternatives and, if regulation is necessary, to select regulatory approaches that maximize net benefits. This NPRM has not been designated a “significant regulatory action,” under section 3(f) of Executive Order 12866, as amended by Executive Order 14094 (Modernizing Regulatory Review). Accordingly, the NPRM has not been reviewed by the Office of Management and Budget (OMB).</P>
                <P>This regulatory action determination is based on the size, location, duration, and time-of-day of the safety zone. Vessel traffic would be able to safely transit around this safety zone which impacts a designated area of the Biscayne Bay for a period of time chosen when vessel traffic is normally low. Moreover, the Coast Guard would issue a NOE, a Broadcast Notice to Mariners via VHF–FM marine channel 16 about the zone, and the rule would allow vessels to seek permission to enter the zone.</P>
                <HD SOURCE="HD2">B. Impact on Small Entities</HD>
                <P>The Regulatory Flexibility Act of 1980, 5 U.S.C. 601–612, as amended, requires Federal agencies to consider the potential impact of regulations on small entities during rulemaking. The term “small entities” comprises small businesses, not-for-profit organizations that are independently owned and operated and are not dominant in their fields, and governmental jurisdictions with populations of less than 50,000. The Coast Guard certifies under 5 U.S.C. 605(b) that this proposed rule would not have a significant economic impact on a substantial number of small entities.</P>
                <P>While some owners or operators of vessels intending to transit the safety zone may be small entities, for the reasons stated in section IV.A above, this proposed rule would not have a significant economic impact on any vessel owner or operator.</P>
                <P>
                    If you think that your business, organization, or governmental jurisdiction qualifies as a small entity and that this proposed rule would have a significant economic impact on it, please submit a comment (see 
                    <E T="02">ADDRESSES</E>
                    ) explaining why you think it qualifies and how and to what degree this rule would economically affect it.
                </P>
                <P>
                    Under section 213(a) of the Small Business Regulatory Enforcement Fairness Act of 1996 (Pub. L. 104–121), we want to assist small entities in understanding this proposed rule. If the proposed rule would affect your small business, organization, or governmental jurisdiction and you have questions concerning its provisions or options for compliance, please call or email the person listed in the 
                    <E T="02">FOR FURTHER INFORMATION CONTACT</E>
                     section. The Coast Guard will not retaliate against small entities that question or complain about this proposed rule or any policy or action of the Coast Guard.

                <P>
                    This proposed rule would not call for a new collection of information under the Paperwork Reduction Act of 1995 (44 U.S.C. 3501–3520).

                <HD SOURCE="HD2">D. Federalism and Indian Tribal Governments</HD>
                <P>A rule has implications for federalism under Executive Order 13132 (Federalism), if it has a substantial direct effect on the States, on the relationship between the National Government and the States, or on the distribution of power and responsibilities among the various levels of government. We have analyzed this proposed rule under that Order and have determined that it is consistent with the fundamental federalism principles and preemption requirements described in Executive Order 13132.</P>
                <P>
                    Also, this proposed rule does not have tribal implications under Executive Order 13175 (Consultation and Coordination with Indian Tribal Governments) because it would not have a substantial direct effect on one or more Indian tribes, on the relationship between the Federal Government and Indian tribes, or on the distribution of power and responsibilities between the Federal Government and Indian tribes.

                <P>The Unfunded Mandates Reform Act of 1995 (2 U.S.C. 1531–1538) requires Federal agencies to assess the effects of their discretionary regulatory actions. In particular, the Act addresses actions that may result in the expenditure by a State, local, or tribal government, in the aggregate, or by the private sector of $100,000,000 (adjusted for inflation) or more in any one year. Though this proposed rule would not result in such an expenditure, we do discuss the potential effects of this proposed rule elsewhere in this preamble.</P>

                    We have analyzed this proposed rule under Department of Homeland Security Directive 023–01, Rev. 1, associated implementing instructions, and Environmental Planning COMDTINST 5090.1 (series), which guide the Coast Guard in complying with the National Environmental Policy Act of 1969 (42 U.S.C. 4321–4370f), and have made a preliminary determination that this action is one of a category of actions that do not individually or cumulatively have a significant effect on the human environment. This proposed rule involves a safety zone to protect persons and vessels operating in the area adjacent to the safety zone. This zone will only be enforced for a few hours at a time, 8–12 times per year. Normally such actions are categorically excluded from further review under paragraph L60(a) of Appendix A, Table 1 of DHS Instruction Manual 023–01–001–01, Rev. 1. A preliminary Record of Environmental Consideration supporting this determination is available in the docket. For instructions on locating the docket, see the

                    <P>
                        The Department of Veterans Affairs (VA) proposes to amend its adjudication regulations relating to exposure to certain herbicide agents to incorporate the provisions of the Blue Water Navy Vietnam Veterans Act of 2019 (the BWN Act), specifically by extending the presumed area of exposure to the offshore waters of the Republic of Vietnam, defining the boundaries of the offshore waters, expanding the date ranges for presumption of exposure in the Korean Demilitarized Zone (DMZ) and establishing entitlement to spina bifida benefits for children of certain Veterans who served in Thailand. This rule also proposes to codify a presumption of exposure to certain herbicide agents for locations published on the Department of Defense's (DoD) record of locations where certain herbicide agents were used, tested or stored outside of Vietnam. In addition, this rule also proposes to codify longstanding procedures for searching for payees entitled to class action settlement payments aligned with

                         and proposes to apply the definition of the Republic of Vietnam's offshore waters to claims for presumptive service connection for non-Hodgkin's lymphoma. VA is also proposing to amend its adjudication regulations concerning presumptive service connection for diseases associated with exposure to certain herbicide agents. This amendment implements provisions of the Fiscal Year (FY) 2021 National Defense Authorization Act (NDAA), which added bladder cancer, hypothyroidism and Parkinsonism as medical conditions eligible for presumptive service connection. Finally, this rulemaking proposes to implement certain provisions of the Sergeant First Class Heath Robinson Honoring our Promise to Address Comprehensive Toxics Act of 2022 (PACT Act), specifically by recognizing hypertension and monoclonal gammopathy of undetermined significance (MGUS) as diseases eligible for a presumption of exposure to certain herbicides and adding new locations as eligible for a presumption of exposure to certain herbicides during specific timeframes.

                <HD SOURCE="HD1">I. Background</HD>
                <P>The spraying of herbicides as tactical defoliants during the Vietnam War began in 1962 and continued until 1971. Public concern over the military's use of herbicides began to grow following requests by scientists to evaluate possible toxic effects of widespread herbicide spraying. To respond to public concern about possible long-term health effects of exposure to herbicides, Congress passed the Veterans' Dioxin and Radiation Exposure Compensation Standards Act, Public Law 98–542. The Act required VA to create guidelines and criteria for deciding claims for benefits based on a Veteran's exposure to herbicides during service in the Republic of Vietnam and established the first presumptions of service connection based on exposure to certain herbicides. The Act also established the Veterans' Advisory Committee on Environmental Hazards to provide findings and evaluations regarding the scientific evidence related to possible adverse health hazards due to exposure to herbicides.</P>
                <P>
                    The results of these studies prompted the Agent Orange Act of 1991, Public Law 102–4, codified in part at 38 U.S.C. 1116. This Act established presumptive service connection for non-Hodgkins lymphoma, soft-tissue sarcoma (with certain exceptions) and chloracne or other consistent acneform diseases. In addition, the Act directed the VA to enter into an agreement with the National Academy of Sciences to review and evaluate the scientific evidence concerning the association between exposure to certain herbicide agents during service in the Republic of Vietnam and each disease suspected to be associated with such exposure. The Act further established guidelines for the evidentiary support needed to create new presumptions of service connection. The Act required that “Whenever the Secretary determines, on the basis of sound medical and scientific evidence, that a positive association exists between (A) the exposure of humans to an herbicide agent, and (B) the occurrence of a disease in humans, the Secretary shall prescribe regulations providing that a 
                    <PRTPAGE P="9804"/>
                    presumption of service connection is warranted for that disease for the purposes of this section.” Public Law 102–4, § 2(a). Since passage of the Act, Congress and VA have established 13 additional presumptions of service connection based on exposure to certain herbicides.

                <P>
                    Prior to the BWN Act, VA interpreted the presumption of exposure to certain herbicide agents for service connection purposes under the Agent Orange Act of 1991, codified in relevant part at 38 U.S.C. 1116(a)(1), to require service within the borders of the Republic of Vietnam, either “boots on the ground” land-based service or service within the inland waterways. If there was evidence that a Veteran went ashore or docked in the Republic of Vietnam, however briefly, the Veteran would be entitled to the presumption of exposure. VA's interpretation was upheld in court until 2019.

                     913 F.3d 1371, 1380 (Fed. Cir. 2019) (en banc). In 2019, the U.S. Court of Appeals for the Federal Circuit held that Congress intended the term “Republic of Vietnam” to include the “territorial sea” of the Republic of Vietnam. The court ruled that by using the formal name of the country, “the Republic of Vietnam,” Congress referred to both its landmass and its 12 nautical mile territorial sea. 
                    <E T="03">Procopio,</E>
                     913 F.3d at 1375. Vietnam's offshore waters were not defined by statute, and the Federal Circuit rejected the distinction between service within the landmass and in the territorial waters when it invalidated the foot-on-land requirement for the Agent Orange presumptions. 
                    <E T="03">Id.</E>
                     at 1378. The court cited international legal authorities to support its holding but did not further attempt to define where the boundaries of the territorial sea of the Republic of Vietnam must be drawn beyond its holding regarding the 12 nautical mile territorial sea.

                    On January 1, 2021, Congress enacted Public Law 116–283, the William M. (Mac) Thornberry National Defense Authorization Act for Fiscal Year 2021 (NDAA). In relevant part, this law amended 38 U.S.C. 1116(a)(2) by adding bladder cancer, hypothyroidism and Parkinsonism to the list of conditions presumptively associated with exposure to certain herbicide agents. The amendment to 38 U.S.C. 1116(a) was based on the 2018 National Academies of Sciences, Engineering, and Medicine report, Veterans and Agent Orange: Update 11, which found limited or suggestive evidence of an association between exposure to certain herbicide agents and bladder cancer, hypothyroidism and Parkinsonism.

                <P>On August 10, 2022, Congress enacted the PACT Act, Public Law 117–168, to improve access to VA benefits and health care for Veterans who were exposed to toxic substances during military service. Section 403 of the PACT Act amended section 1116 of title 38, United States Code by adding new locations as eligible for a presumption of exposure to certain herbicide agents: Thailand (at any United States or Royal Thai base), Laos, Cambodia at Mimot or Krek, Kampong Cham Province, Johnston Atoll, Guam, and American Samoa, during certain timeframes. Prior to the PACT Act, the only location subject to a statuory presumption of exposure to certain herbicides was the Republic of Vietnam. Therefore, VA is proposing to add these additional locations to VA's Part 3 Regulations at 38 CFR 3.307.</P>
                <P>Section 404 of the PACT Act added hypertension and MGUS as diseases associated with exposure to certain herbicide agents under 38 U.S.C. 1116(a)(2). Therefore, VA is proposing to add these diseases to 38 CFR 3.309, disease subject to presumptive service connection.</P>

                     and the BWN Act, Veterans who served in the “offshore waters” were only presumed to have been exposed to certain herbicide agents if there was evidence that the conditions of their service involved duty or visitation in the Republic of Vietnam. VA proposes to amend 38 CFR 3.307(a)(6) to clarify that service in the offshore waters of the Republic of Vietnam—without an additional foot-on-land requirement—is considered service in Vietnam for the purpose of establishing presumption of in-service exposure to certain herbicide agents.

The Act includes a list of geographic points with their names and coordinates of latitude and longitude which, when connected by a series of lines, create the baseline from which the 12 nautical miles that define the offshore waters of the Republic of Vietnam are measured.

                    The BWN Act does not direct how the southwestern-most and northern-most points of the offshore waters are to be connected to land, which would be necessary to create a fully defined geographic area. To define the offshore water of the Republic of Vietnam, the law provides 11 geographic points located 12 miles seaward from the coast of the Republic of Vietnam. The law does not dictate how the end points connect to land. Initially, VA considered using straight lines to define where the end points connect to land. However, using a straight line to connect the westernmost point to land would bisect the southern tip of Vietnam's Phu Quoc Island. VA now proposes to have this line include the entire island. This Veteran-centric approach would help avoid denials of service connection for Veterans who may have been exposed in the coastal and inland waters of Phu Quoc. Further, VA views the inclusion of the offshore waters of Phu Quoc island to be consistent with Congress's intent that VA extend the presumption of in-service exposure to certain herbicide agents to all applicable BWN veterans in a “broad and comprehensive” manner.

The northern demarcation is proposed to be described as a line from the mid-point of the Ben Hai River, which denotes the demilitarized zone between the former North Vietnam and the Republic of Vietnam (17°0′42.19″ N, 107°6′35.47″ E), to the point described as Con Co Island, Binh Tri Thien Province.
                </P>
                <P>The proposed area that comprises the offshore waters of the Republic of Vietnam is designated solely for the purpose of determining presumption of in-service exposure to certain herbicide agents in order to establish entitlement to benefits under title 38 of the United States Code. The proposed rulemaking is not an endorsement of any state's sovereignty rights or jurisdiction under international law. The status of some of the waters in and around the area addressed in the proposed regulation was in dispute during the Vietnam Era and may still be in dispute. Because of this, the proposed rule includes a note in 38 CFR 3.307 that clarifies that the purpose of the regulation is for claim adjudication purposes and is not a statement or endorsement of international boundaries.</P>
                <P>VA also proposes to amend 38 CFR 3.307(a)(6) for exposures related to service in the Korean demilitarized zone (DMZ) by proposing to expand the date range for presumption of exposure to certain herbicide agents for Veterans who served in units operating in or near the Korean DMZ. Currently, the date range contained in section 3.307(a)(6)(iv) is April 1, 1968, through August 31, 1971. The BWN Act expanded the date range to September 1, 1967, through August 31, 1971. 38 U.S.C. 1116B(a)(2).</P>
                <P>Over the past few years, VA has received several requests to engage in rulemaking with regard to presumptive exposure to certain herbicide agents. Some of the requests have pertained to the Republic of Vietnam and its surrounds, such as Da Nang Harbor and Phu Quoc Island, and seem to be resolved by the BWN Act and this rulemaking, with the proposed changes to 38 CFR 3.307(a)(6) described above. That said, VA still welcomes any and all comments on these issues.</P>
                <P>There have also been requests to extend a presumption of exposure to certain herbicide agents to Veterans who served at additional locations outside Vietnam, such as Panama and Okinawa. In response to some of these requests, VA committed to open a rulemaking that would consider extending the presumption of exposure to certain herbicide agents beyond the categories of Veterans currently listed in 38 CFR 3.307(a)(6)(iii)–(v). This is that rulemaking and, after serious consideration, VA is proposing to extend a presumption of exposure to certain herbicide agents by adding new paragraph 38 CFR 3.307(a)(6)(xi), which would presume exposure to certain herbicide agents for Veterans who served in locations not otherwise listed under section 3.307(a)(6) where certain herbicides and their chemical components were tested, used or stored, based on information received from DoD.</P>
                <P>From 2018 to 2019, DoD reviewed thousands of government documents from a variety of sources to include the National Archives and Records Administration, Air Force Historical Research Agency, United States Department of Agriculture National Agricultural Library and Defense Technical Information Center. Information obtained from these documents was assessed against criteria developed jointly by VA and DoD to identify specific locations inside and outside the United States where certain herbicide agents and their chemical components were tested, used, or stored. The record of locations is a “living document,” and the Armed Forces Pest Management Board (AFPMB) has been assigned responsibility by the Under Secretary of Defense for Acquisition and Sustainment to maintain and update this list and ensure that it is current and accurate. The AFPMB conducts a review of the DoD list of locations annually and accepts submissions from members of the public in furtherance of updating the list.</P>
                <P>
                    Because DoD's list is premised on a comprehensive review of thousands of government documents, and the list will continue to be informed and updated through the submission of evidence by members of the public as well as internal research, VA utilizes the list as the most reliable source of information informing the question of where to establish regulatory presumptions of exposure to certain herbicide agents. VA believes that the list's acknowledgment of certain herbicide agent usage, testing or storage at particular sites on particular dates warrants a presumption of exposure to certain herbicide agents that lessens the ordinary burden of proof for Veterans who reasonably would have visited those sites on those dates. 
                    <E T="03">See</E>

                <P>
                    In August 2019, DoD conveyed to VA its updated list of locations where certain herbicide agents were used, tested or stored. The list references (1) each location where certain herbicide agents were present, (2) the specific site of that presence, (3) the dates of that presence, (4) the purpose of that presence, (5) the personnel involved, and (6) the name of the herbicide agent or component involved. The list (and links to the criteria informing its creation) can be found at: 
                    <E T="03">https://www.publichealth.va.gov/exposures/agentorange/locations/tests-storage/index.asp.</E>
                     While DoD is the lead agency for producing and updating the list of locations where certain herbicide agents were used, tested or stored, VA is the lead agency responsible for making this information easily accessible to Veterans and keeping them informed of the benefits to which they may be entitled based on their service. VA keeps the public informed by publishing the list on the VA public health website and updating the published list as locations are added or removed. In addition, VA will provide notice in the 
                    <E T="04">Federal Register</E>
                     whenever updates are made to the DoD list.
                </P>
                <P>
                    Given that DoD will continue to maintain and update the list of locations where certain herbicide agents were used, tested or stored, VA proposes to implement a regulatory presumption of exposure that can evolve with the most current DoD list. Thus, VA proposes an additional paragraph to 38 CFR 3.307 that would presume exposure to certain herbicide agents for Veterans (who do not qualify for the presumption under paragraphs (a)(6)(iii)–(v) or new paragraphs (a)(6)(vi)–(x) discussed below in Section II.b.) whose circumstances of service reasonably would have placed them at a site of certain herbicide agent testing, use or storage on a date of certain herbicide testing, use or storage. The authoritative source regarding where and when certain herbicide agents were tested, used or stored, for purposes of this additional paragraph, would be the information provided by DoD that is publicly available on VA's website and through VA's notices in the 
                    <E T="04">Federal Register</E>
                    .
                </P>
                <P>
                    This presumption would alleviate the need for a Veteran to have to prove actual involvement with certain herbicide agents, so long as that Veteran's circumstances of service would reasonably have placed the Veteran at certain sites on certain dates. For veterans who do not qualify for the presumption, VA will continue to consider and decide claims on a case-by-case basis considering all the evidence of record. Such Veterans will have the opportunity to present 
                    <PRTPAGE P="9806"/>
                    evidence that they were exposed to certain herbicide agents, VA will consider all evidence of record (including lay statements) in rendering a determination on exposure, and VA will give the benefit of the doubt to the Veteran; but a presumption that lessens the ordinary burden of proof under 38 U.S.C. 5107 will not apply. Otherwise stated, Veterans in such a position will have the opportunity to establish in-service exposure to certain herbicide agents on a direct basis, but not a presumptive basis.
                </P>
                <P>The purpose of this regulatory change is to ensure consistency across VA adjudications, in accord with the most up-to-date information garnered by DoD. Structuring the regulation in this way will also eliminate the need for adjudicators to continually rely on sub-regulatory guidance or the need for VA to amend its regulations every time DoD updates its list.</P>
                <P>For several reasons, VA decided not to propose to extend a regulatory presumption beyond the statutory requirements and the DoD list at this time. First, any official declaration by VA that a certain herbicide agent was presumably present in a particular location should be based on a comprehensive review of all available records, not based on speculation, assumption or limited evidence. While individual Veteran recollections, photographs and soil samples decades after the fact can provide relevant evidence in support of an individual's pursuit of direct service connection, it is most appropriate to rely on the most comprehensive review—from the agency that has access to the most relevant documents—when establishing a regulatory presumption. Second, as noted above, direct service connection remains available for any Veteran who alleges exposure to certain herbicide agents (no matter the Veteran's location of service), and due consideration will be given to all the evidence that veteran submits, with the benefit of the doubt given to the Veteran. Tailoring the presumption in this way does not at all foreclose any Veteran alleging exposure to certain herbicide agents from obtaining benefits. Third, there is reason for VA to be cautious in presuming or making declarations about herbicide agent presence when DoD has superior access to relevant records and superior knowledge of its own operations. While some inconsistency in government positions, statements and decisions is inevitable given the size and complexity of Federal operations, it is confusing and illogical for one agency to create a rule that will have the force and effect of law that by its very premise depends upon a factual proposition that another agency with superior expertise or authority does not credit. Otherwise stated, for VA to presume an herbicide agent presence that DoD steadfastly denies after exhaustive research could implicate issues beyond VA benefits and result in widespread confusion about what the government believes to be fact. The better resolution is for VA and members of the public to submit all relevant evidence to DoD, so that the DoD list continues to evolve with the most up-to-date information, and for veterans to continue to submit evidence along with their individual claims.</P>
                <P>VA recognizes that locations like Panama and Okinawa, Japan, are not on DoD's current list of locations where certain herbicide agents were used, tested or stored, and therefore would not warrant a presumption at this time. Ultimately, VA believes that linking its presumption with DoD's current herbicide agent list (which, as noted above, is a living document and therefore may evolve, upon the review of additional submitted evidence, to include locations like Panama and Okinawa) is the best course of action, but VA nevertheless welcomes all comments on this approach, or comments on Panama and Okinawa specifically, during the comment period for this rulemaking.</P>
                <HD SOURCE="HD2">b. Amendments to § 3.307 Based on the PACT Act</HD>
                <P>As explained above, 38 CFR 3.307(a)(6) outlines the service requirements and other circumstances required for the presumption of exposure to certain herbicide agents. Currently, 38 CFR 3.307(a)(6) lists two locations as eligible for a presumption of exposure: the Republic of Vietnam and units that operated in or near the Korean DMZ in an area in which herbicides are known to have been applied. Based on section 403 of the PACT Act, VA is proposing to add the following locations to 38 CFR 3.307(a)(6) with corresponding eligible timeframes: (1) service in Thailand at any United States or Royal Thai base during the period beginning on January 9, 1962, and ending on June 30, 1976; (2) service in Laos during the period beginning on December 1, 1965, and ending on September 30, 1969; (3) service in Cambodia at Mimot or Krek, Kampong Cham Province during the period beginning on April 16, 1969, and ending on April 30, 1969; (4) service in Guam or American Samoa, or in the territorial waters thereof, during the period beginning on January 9, 1962, and ending on July 31, 1980; and (5) service on Johnston Atoll or on a ship that called at Johnston Atoll during the period beginning on January 1, 1972, and ending on September 30, 1977. These new locations will be added to 38 CFR 3.307(a)(6) by creating new paragraphs (a)(6)(vi–x).</P>
                <P>
                    To determine the territorial waters of Guam and American Samoa, VA relied on coordinates from the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration. The electronic charts can be found here:

                </P>
                <P>
                    For claims based on service in Thailand, VA interprets the language of section 403 to include service on a ship that called to a coastal Thailand base. Section 403 provides a presumption of exposure to Veterans who served in Thailand at any United States or Royal Thai base during the period beginning on January 9, 1962, and ending on June 30, 1976. As the PACT Act definition of covered service in Thailand includes 
                    <E T="03">any</E>
                     United States or Royal Thai bases in Thailand, VA finds it reasonable to include service aboard a ship at any coastal Thailand base. Under this interpretation, any Veteran who served on a ship that called to a coastal base in Thailand is eligible for a presumption of exposure to certain herbicides.
                </P>
                <P>VA's current policy regarding claims based on Thailand service is contained in sub-regulatory guidance and considers exposure on a case-by-case direct basis for security personnel, security patrol dog handlers, or other Service members whose daily activities placed them near the security perimeters of Thailand military bases during the Vietnam Era. Proposed 38 CFR 3.307(a)(6)(vi) would supplant that sub-regulatory guidance, as this new paragraph would presume exposure to certain herbicides for all veterans who served in Thailand at any U.S. or Royal Thai base between January 9, 1962, and June 30, 1976, without regard to where on the base the veteran was located or what military job specialty the Veteran performed.</P>
                <P>
                    For claims based on service in Johnston Atoll or on a ship that called to Johnston Atoll, 38 U.S.C. 1116(d)(5) defines covered service to include service “on Johnston Atoll or on a ship that called at Johnston Atoll during the period beginning on January 1, 1972, and ending on September 30, 1977.” Section 1116(d)(5) specifies two categories of service related to Johnston Atoll that constitute covered service: (1) service on Johnston Atoll and (2) service on a ship that called at Johnston Atoll. VA understands 38 U.S.C. 1116(d)(5)'s date range to refer to the dates of the veteran's service in the location (the 
                    <PRTPAGE P="9807"/>
                    Atoll itself or on a ship), and that the date range provided in the statute applies to both categories. VA thus proposes to amend 38 CFR 3.307(a)(6) to make clear that the presumption of exposure to certain herbicides applies when the veteran was present on Johnston Atoll, to include presence on the the ship when it called at Johnston Atoll, even if the veteran did not disembark, during the qualifying period.

                    VA also proposes to include parenthetical language for Parkinsonism that identifies the most common forms of Parkinsonism known as Parkinson-plus syndromes (also referred to as atypical Parkinsonism). The most common Parkinson-plus syndromes are progressive supranuclear palsy (PSP), multiple system atrophy (MSA) (also referred to as Shy-Drager syndrome), corticobasal degeneration (CBD), vascular Parkinsonism, and dementia with Lewy bodies (DLB).

If a Veteran has a diagnosis of drug-induced Parkinsonism and a medical examiner opines that the disease is due to medication required for a service-connected condition, the claim for service connection for drug-induced Parkinsonism may be granted on a secondary basis. To provide clarity, VA further proposes to add a new note to 38 CFR 3.309(e) to explain that drug-induced Parkinsonism is not recognized as a disease associated with exposure to certain herbicide agents.

                <P>
                    38 CFR 3.313 provides regulatory guidance for establishing service connection for non-Hodgkin's lymphoma (NHL) based on service in “Vietnam.” Currently, service connection for NHL requires a medical diagnosis and evidence showing service on land in Vietnam or service in Vietnam's offshore waters. (The current regulatory provision does not distinguish between “Vietnam” and the “Republic of Vietnam.”) Before the 
                    <E T="03">Procopio</E>
                     decision, service solely in the offshore waters was not sufficient to grant service connection for any condition except NHL.
                </P>
                <P>
                    Based on the definition of Vietnam's offshore waters in the BWN Act, claims for NHL will no longer be held to a separate standard of service connection than other conditions listed under 38 CFR 3.309(e). Furthermore, because the current regulatory guidance does not distinguish between “Vietnam” and the “Republic of Vietnam,” VA is proposing to amend its adjudication regulations to specify that in order to establish presumptive service connection for NHL, service must have been in the “Republic of Vietnam,” to ensure that the regulation is consistent with the statutory definition of Vietnam's offshore waters. VA notes that, in light of 
                    <E T="03">Procopio</E>
                     and the BWN Act, the scope and effect of section 3.313 are essentially coextensive with section 3.309(e) as the latter applies to NHL. However, VA proposes to revise, rather than rescind, section 3.313 because this provision could have an independent effect in rare cases, as it does not depend on a rebuttable presumption of herbicide agent exposure.

Since the BWN Act authorizes VA to extend these benefits to children of Veterans with covered service in Thailand, VA proposes to add individuals with spina bifida born to Veterans with covered service in Thailand as a category of claimants who are entitled to consideration for an effective date as specified in this regulation.</P>

                <P>Individuals born with spina bifida whose biological father or mother was determined to be exposed to certain herbicide agents in Vietnam or Korea have long been eligible for a monthly monetary allowance under 38 U.S.C. chapter 18, based on the severity of their spina bifida symptoms. However, this eligibility did not extend to natural children of Thailand Veterans for whom certain herbicide agent exposure has been conceded, nor did it extend to natural children of Veterans who served in the offshore waters of the Republic of Vietnam. 38 CFR 3.814 is the regulation that provides for entitlement to this monetary allowance under 38 U.S.C. chapter 18 and sets forth the criteria that must be met in order to establish such entitlement. The BWN Act expanded eligibility for spina bifida benefits to natural children of certain Thailand Veterans, as well as natural children of Veterans who served in the offshore waters of the Republic of Vietnam. This proposed rulemaking updates the criteria accordingly.</P>

The PACT Act defined covered service in Thailand, in 38 U.S.C. 1116(d)(2), as “active military, naval, air, or space service-performed in Thailand at any United States or Royal Thai base during the period beginning on January 9, 1962, and ending on June 30, 1976, without regard to where on the base the Veteran was located or what military job specialty the Veteran performed.” Prior to the PACT Act, 38 U.S.C. 1822 provided benefits to children born with spina bifida whose parent served in Thailand any time between January 9, 1962, and May 7, 1975. The PACT Act did not amend 38 U.S.C. 1822. For purposes of establishing entitlement to monetary benefits for spina bifida under 38 U.S.C. Chapter 18, VA proposes to define covered service in Thailand as “service at any United States or Royal Thai base during the period beginning on January 9, 1962, and ending on May 7, 1975, without regard to where on the base the Veteran was located or what military job specialty the Veteran performed.” This definition includes the description of covered service from 38 U.S.C. 1116 but maintains the eligible time frame from 38 U.S.C. 1822. VA has determined that aligning the definitions of what characterizes Thailand service will improve the consistency of decisions for Thailand Veterans and their survivors.</P>
                <P>For the purposes of establishing entitlement to monetary benefits for spina bifida under 38 U.S.C. chapter 18, VA is proposing to include the offshore waters of the Republic of Vietnam in the definition of service in the Republic of Vietnam. In accordance with the BWN Act, VA further proposes to amend 38 CFR 3.814(c)(1) to align with the definition of “service in the Republic of Vietnam” set forth in the proposed amendment to 38 CFR 3.307(a)(6)(iii).</P>
                <P>
                    Further, in accordance with the BWN Act, VA is extending the date range for establishing presumption of exposure along the Korean DMZ from April 1, 1968, through August 31, 1971, to September 1, 1967, through August 31, 1971.

                     38 U.S.C. 1116B(a)(2). VA proposes to amend the start date in 38 CFR 3.814(c)(2) to reflect the date mandated by the new statute.
                </P>
                <P>VA also proposes replacing the phrase “biological son or daughter” in 38 CFR 3.814(c)(4) with “natural child” consistent with the clerical amendment proposed for 38 CFR 3.114(a).</P>

                <P>Prior to the BWN Act, if a Veteran mother only had service in the offshore waters of the Republic of Vietnam and did not go ashore or serve in the inland waterways, that service did not qualify for entitlement to a monthly monetary award for any natural children born with qualifying birth defects. The Act expanded the definition of “Vietnam Veteran” to include Veterans who served in the offshore waters of the Republic of Vietnam. Therefore, VA proposes to amend 38 CFR 3.815 accordingly.</P>
                <P>38 CFR 3.815 provides for a monetary allowance under 38 U.S.C. 1812 for individuals with disability due to covered birth defects whose biological mother is or was a Vietnam Veteran. Covered birth defects include any birth defect other than familial disorders, birth-related injuries, or fetal or neonatal infirmity with well-established causes. All birth defects not excluded under these categories are covered birth defects. However, if an individual's only birth defect is spina bifida, their monthly monetary allowance will be paid under the provisions of 38 U.S.C. 1803, 1821, and 1822, which provide a monthly monetary award for children of certain herbicide agent-exposed Veteran parents who served in Vietnam, Thailand or near the Korean DMZ.</P>
                <P>In accordance with the BWN Act, VA proposes to amend 38 CFR 3.815(c)(1) to align the definition of “service in the Republic of Vietnam” with the definition set forth in the proposed amendment to 38 CFR 3.307(a)(6)(iii).</P>
                <HD SOURCE="HD1">VIII. Proposed Changes to § 3.105 Revision of Decisions</HD>
                <P>38 CFR 3.105(g), which describes procedural requirements for reductions in evaluations under 38 U.S.C. chapter 18 for children of certain herbicide agent-exposed Veterans, currently only applies to children of Vietnam Veterans born with spina bifida or children of Veterans with covered service in Korea born with spina bifida who were entitled to benefits. Because the BWN Act authorized VA to extend those benefits under 38 U.S.C. chapter 18 to children of certain Veterans who served in Thailand born with spina bifida, VA proposes to add these children to the category of claimants who are covered by the procedural provisions specified in this regulation. Since natural children of Veterans with covered service in Thailand are a newly covered type of claimant, it is necessary to add them as a category of claimants who are covered by the procedural provisions of 38 CFR 3.105. This ensures that benefits awarded to these claimants cannot be severed or reduced until the claimant has been afforded time to present evidence in support of maintaining their benefits.</P>
                <P>Finally, VA proposes a clerical amendment to section 3.105(g) by replacing the word “children” with the phrase “natural children” wherever it occurs in the regulation. As is true with the proposed amendment to 38 CFR 3.114(a), this is a clerical change made to reflect the statutory definition of “child” for purposes of benefits for children of certain Veterans born with spina bifida. See 38 U.S.C. 1831(1).</P>

                <P>
                    VA proposes to codify the current procedural guidance regarding locating the appropriate survivor(s) of a deceased 
                    <E T="03">Nehmer</E>
                     class member and defining the parameters of “reasonable efforts” to identify them. VA is also codifying its existing policy to pay newly identified qualifying payees before attempting recoupment from improperly compensated payees, rather than waiting for recoupment before paying the newly identified qualifying payees. The intent of this change is to ensure compliance with the 
                    <E T="03">Nehmer</E>
                     consent decree.
                </P>
                <P>
                    Historically, VA has sought to locate payees for potential retroactive 
                    <E T="03">Nehmer</E>
                     benefits by sending letters to all dependents of record requesting the names, addresses and telephone numbers of all known survivors. VA will also seek to obtain proof of dependency documents such as birth certificates, marriages certificates and other proof of dependency, if necessary.
                </P>
                <P>
                    If payees cannot be identified, VA will make reasonable efforts to locate payees as the information on file permits. For example, if a claimant's record identifies an authorized representative or a relative, it would be reasonable to contact such person to request information concerning the 
                    <PRTPAGE P="9809"/>
                    existence of a surviving spouse, child(ren), parent(s) or the executor/administrator of the class member's estate. It would be unreasonable to attempt to locate a payee where there is no evidence of record to suggest that the party would potentially qualify for retroactive benefits.
                </P>
                <P>
                    If the evidence of record does not contain sufficient information to identify an eligible 
                    <E T="03">Nehmer</E>
                     class beneficiary, a letter will be sent to the last known address of the Veteran, and VA will wait 30 days for a response. If an address is unknown, an attempt will be made to contact the survivor by telephone to obtain their address.
                </P>
                <P>
                    This proposed regulation codifies the procedure for locating 
                    <E T="03">Nehmer</E>
                     payees as follows: Claims processors must review the claims folder for relevant information and review other VA resources including, but not limited to, benefit applications, statements from the veteran, medical records, corporate database and claims processing system notes. If review of both the claims folder and electronic claims processing system do not provide beneficiary contact information, claims processors must contact any known authorized representatives of record (including those who provided first notice of death and/or funeral/burial services). Claims processors also must attempt to locate potential payees using online public record investigation software authorized by VA. If, after this review, no beneficiary, authorized representative or next of kin is located, the claims processor will send (i) a letter to the Veteran's last known address and wait 30 days for a response and (ii) attempt contact via last known telephonic contact information. If no response is received at the expiration of 30 days, the claims processor will annotate in the claims folder all actions taken to identify eligible payees. The claims processor will then add the claim data to communications with 
                    <E T="03">Nehmer</E>
                     class counsel, as VA is required to provide class counsel with a list of every claim where eligible survivors cannot be located.
                </P>
                <P>
                    Given the universe of information in the VA benefits system available to claims processors and the measures VA proposes to identify eligible beneficiaries and contact individuals who may provide information about eligible beneficiaries unknown to VA, this procedural guidance constitutes what VA has determined to be reasonable efforts to identify all appropriate 
                    <E T="03">Nehmer</E>
                     payees. VA does not believe it is reasonable to pay private search firms or undertake extraordinary efforts beyond those identified in this regulation to identify potential payees.
                </P>
                <P>
                    If, following such efforts, VA releases the full amount of unpaid benefits to a payee or payees, and additional qualifying payees subsequently identify themselves to VA, VA will pay the newly identified payee(s) the portion of the award to which they are entitled, and then attempt to recover the overpayment from the original payee(s). While this is consistent with VA's current policy, the revision is necessary in light of the December 2, 2021, amendment to 38 CFR 3.816(f)(3), which was required by the November 10, 2021, court order in

                     86 FR 68409 (Dec. 2, 2021). VA is obligated to issue payment to the newly identified payee(s) regardless of whether it previously disbursed the entirety of an award to the original payee(s). As noted by the U.S. Court of Appeals for Veterans Claims in 
                    <E T="03">Snyder</E>
                     v. 
                    <E T="03">Principi,</E>
                     the prior disbursement “in no way impairs [VA's] authority and obligation to pay from the compensation . . . account the amount that is owed to the correct beneficiary.” 15 Vet. App. 285, 292 (2001). This is because “the amount owed to the correct beneficiary, in fact, remains undisturbed in the compensation . . . account.” 
                    <E T="03">Id.</E>
                     Nevertheless, payment to newly identified payees does not relieve VA of its corresponding obligation to recover the overpayment to the original payees.

                <P>
                    Executive Order (E.O.) 12866 (Regulatory Planning and Review) directs agencies to assess the costs and benefits of available regulatory alternatives and, when regulation is necessary, to select regulatory approaches that maximize net benefits (including potential economic, environmental, public health and safety effects, and other advantages; distributive impacts; and equity). E.O. 13563 (Improving Regulation and Regulatory Review) emphasizes the importance of quantifying both costs and benefits, reducing costs, harmonizing rules, and promoting flexibility. E.O. 14094 (E.O. on Modernizing Regulatory Review) supplements and reaffirms the principles, structures, and definitions governing contemporary regulatory review established in E.O. 12866 of September 30, 1993 (Regulatory Planning and Review), and E.O. 13563 of January 18, 2011 (Improving Regulation and Regulatory Review). The Office of Information and Regulatory Affairs has determined that this rulemaking is a significant regulatory action under E.O. 12866, Section 3(f)(1), as amended by E.O. 14094.

The factual basis for this certification is that no small entities or businesses provide Federal compensation or pension benefits to Veterans, and such entities or businesses therefore would be unaffected by the proposed rule. Therefore, pursuant to 5 U.S.C. 605(b), the initial and final regulatory flexibility analysis requirements of 5 U.S.C. 603 and 604 do not apply.

                         An individual who performed service in the Air Force or Air Force Reserve under circumstances in which the individual concerned regularly and repeatedly operated, maintained, or served onboard C–123 aircraft known to have been used to spray an herbicide agent during the Vietnam era shall be presumed to have been exposed during such service to an herbicide agent. For purposes of this paragraph, “regularly and repeatedly operated, maintained, or served onboard C–123 aircraft” means that the individual was assigned to an Air Force or Air Force Reserve squadron when the squadron was permanently assigned one of the affected aircraft and the individual had an Air Force Specialty Code indicating duties as a flight, ground maintenance, or medical crew member on such aircraft. Such exposure constitutes an injury under 38 U.S.C. 101(24)(B) and (C). If an individual described in this paragraph develops a disease listed in 38 CFR 3.309(e) as specified in paragraph (a)(6)(ii) of this section, it will be presumed that the individual concerned became disabled during that service for purposes of establishing that the individual served in the active military, naval, or air service.

                <P>On October 28, 2022, the EPA determined that the submittal for Rule 7.15 met the completeness criteria in 40 CFR part 51 Appendix V, which must be met before formal EPA review.</P>
                <HD SOURCE="HD2">B. Are there other versions of this rule?</HD>
                <P>There are no previous versions of Rule 7.15 in the California SIP. The FRAQMD originally adopted an earlier version of this rule on December 6, 2010, but that version of the rule was never submitted for inclusion in the SIP. The FRAQMD amended Rule 7.15 on April 4, 2022. If we take final action to approve the April 4, 2022 version of Rule 7.15, this version will be incorporated into the SIP.</P>
                <HD SOURCE="HD2">C. What is the purpose of the submitted rule?</HD>
                <P>Under sections 182(d)(3), (e), (f) and 185 of the Act, states with ozone nonattainment areas classified as “Severe” or “Extreme” are required to submit a SIP revision that requires major stationary sources of volatile organic compounds (VOC) or oxides of nitrogen (NOx) emissions in the area to pay a fee if the area fails to attain the standard by the attainment date. The required SIP revision must provide for annual payment of the fees, computed in accordance with CAA section 185(b).</P>
                <P>
                    The Sacramento Metro, CA ozone nonattainment area has been classified as Severe for the 1979 1-hour, 1997 8-hour, and 2008 8-hour ozone National Ambient Air Quality Standards (NAAQS). The Sacramento Metro area includes a portion of Sutter County that is under the jurisdiction of the FRAQMD. The EPA has previously issued a finding that the State of California had failed to submit the required revisions for the 1-hour ozone NAAQS for portions of the Sacramento Metro area, including the portion under the jurisdiction of the FRAQMD.

                     The FRAQMD submitted Rule 7.15 for the portion of the Sacramento Metro area under the jurisdiction of the District to satisfy the requirement to submit a CAA section 185 fee program for each federal ozone NAAQS for which the Sacramento Metro area is classified as Severe or Extreme.

                         January 5, 2010 (75 FR 232). Although the imposition of sanctions due to this finding was deferred on May 18, 2011 (76 FR 28661), and was permanently stopped with our October 28, 2022 completeness letter, there remains an obligation for the EPA to promulgate a federal implementation plan (FIP) associated with the January 5, 2010 action.

                <HD SOURCE="HD1">II. The EPA's Evaluation and Action</HD>
                <HD SOURCE="HD2">A. How is the EPA evaluating the rule?</HD>
                <P>Rules in the SIP must be enforceable (see CAA section 110(a)(2)), must not interfere with applicable requirements concerning attainment and reasonable further progress or other CAA requirements (see CAA section 110(l)), and must not modify certain SIP control requirements in nonattainment areas without ensuring equivalent or greater emissions reductions (see CAA section 193). The EPA is also evaluating the rule for consistency with the statutory requirements of CAA section 185.</P>
                <P>Guidance and policy documents that we used to evaluate enforceability, revision/relaxation and rule stringency requirements for the applicable criteria pollutants include the following:</P>
                <P>1. “State Implementation Plans; General Preamble for the Implementation of Title I of the Clean Air Act Amendments of 1990,” 57 FR 13498 (April 16, 1992); 57 FR 18070 (April 28, 1992).</P>

                <HD SOURCE="HD2">B. Does the rule meet the evaluation criteria?</HD>
                <P>This rule meets CAA requirements and is consistent with relevant guidance regarding enforceability and SIP revisions. The EPA's technical support document (TSD) has more information on our evaluation.</P>

                <P>The TSD includes recommendations for the next time the local agency amends the rule.</P>
                <HD SOURCE="HD2">D. Proposed Action and Public Comment</HD>
                <P>As authorized in section 110(k)(3) of the Act, the EPA proposes to approve submitted Rule 7.15 because it fulfills all relevant requirements. The rule is not limited to a particular ozone NAAQS, and we therefore propose to find that it satisfies the District's obligations under the 1979 1-hour, 1997 8-hour, and 2008 8-hour ozone NAAQS. We will accept comments from the public on this proposal until March 13, 2024. If we take final action to approve the submitted rule, our final action will incorporate this rule into the federally enforceable SIP and address the EPA's obligation to promulgate a FIP arising from our previous finding that the State of California has failed to submit the required CAA section 185 SIP revisions for the 1-hour ozone NAAQS for the portion of the Sacramento Metro area under the jurisdiction of the FRAQMD.</P>
                <HD SOURCE="HD1">III. Incorporation by Reference</HD>
                <P>
                    In this rule, the EPA is proposing to include in a final EPA rule regulatory text that includes incorporation by reference. In accordance with requirements of 1 CFR 51.5, the EPA is proposing to incorporate by reference FRAQMD Rule 7.15, “Clean Air Act 
                    <PRTPAGE P="9815"/>
                    Nonattainment Fees,” amended on April 4, 2022, which addresses the CAA section 185 fee program requirements. The EPA has made, and will continue to make, these materials available through 
                    <E T="03">https://www.regulations.gov</E>
                     and at the EPA Region IX Office (please contact the person identified in the

                     section of this preamble for more information).
                </P>
                <HD SOURCE="HD1">IV. Statutory and Executive Order Reviews</HD>
                <P>Under the Clean Air Act, the Administrator is required to approve a SIP submission that complies with the provisions of the Act and applicable federal regulations. 42 U.S.C. 7410(k); 40 CFR 52.02(a). Thus, in reviewing SIP submissions, the EPA's role is to approve state choices, provided that they meet the criteria of the Clean Air Act. Accordingly, this proposed action merely proposes to approve state law as meeting federal requirements and does not impose additional requirements beyond those imposed by state law. For that reason, this proposed action:</P>
                <P>• Is not a significant regulatory action subject to review by the Office of Management and Budget under Executive Orders 12866 (58 FR 51735, October 4, 1993) and 14094 (88 FR 21879, April 11, 2023);</P>
                <P>
                    • Does not impose an information collection burden under the provisions of the Paperwork Reduction Act (44 U.S.C. 3501 
                    <E T="03">et seq.</E>
                    );
                </P>
                <P>
                    • Is certified as not having a significant economic impact on a substantial number of small entities under the Regulatory Flexibility Act (5 U.S.C. 601 
                    <E T="03">et seq.</E>
                    );
                </P>
                <P>• Does not contain any unfunded mandate or significantly or uniquely affect small governments, as described in the Unfunded Mandates Reform Act of 1995 (Pub. Law 104–4);</P>
                <P>• Does not have federalism implications as specified in Executive Order 13132 (64 FR 43255, August 10, 1999);</P>
                <P>• Is not subject to Executive Order 13045 (62 FR 19885, April 23, 1997) because it proposes to approve a state program;</P>
                <P>• Is not a significant regulatory action subject to Executive Order 13211 (66 FR 28355, May 22, 2001); and</P>
                <P>• Is not subject to requirements of Section 12(d) of the National Technology Transfer and Advancement Act of 1995 (15 U.S.C. 272 note) because application of those requirements would be inconsistent with the Clean Air Act.</P>
                <P>In addition, the SIP is not approved to apply on any Indian reservation land or in any other area where the EPA or an Indian tribe has demonstrated that a tribe has jurisdiction. In those areas of Indian country, the rule does not have tribal implications and will not impose substantial direct costs on tribal governments or preempt tribal law as specified by Executive Order 13175 (65 FR 67249, November 9, 2000).</P>
                <P>Executive Order 12898 (Federal Actions To Address Environmental Justice in Minority Populations and Low-Income Populations, 59 FR 7629, Feb. 16, 1994) directs Federal agencies to identify and address “disproportionately high and adverse human health or environmental effects” of their actions on minority populations and low-income populations to the greatest extent practicable and permitted by law. The EPA defines environmental justice (EJ) as “the fair treatment and meaningful involvement of all people regardless of race, color, national origin, or income with respect to the development, implementation, and enforcement of environmental laws, regulations, and policies.” The EPA further defines the term fair treatment to mean that “no group of people should bear a disproportionate burden of environmental harms and risks, including those resulting from the negative environmental consequences of industrial, governmental, and commercial operations or programs and policies.”</P>
                <P>The State did not evaluate environmental justice considerations as part of its SIP submittal; the CAA and applicable implementing regulations neither prohibit nor require such an evaluation. The EPA did not perform an EJ analysis and did not consider EJ in this action. Consideration of EJ is not required as part of this action, and there is no information in the record inconsistent with the stated goal of E.O. 12898 of achieving environmental justice for people of color, low-income populations, and Indigenous peoples.</P>

                        The Environmental Protection Agency (EPA or the Agency) is providing notice of our intent to redesignate portions of Westmoreland County and Cambria County, Pennsylvania, to “nonattainment” for the 2010 sulfur dioxide (SO
                        <E T="52">2</E>
                        ) national ambient air quality standard (NAAQS or standard). Westmoreland County is currently designated “attainment/unclassifiable,” and Cambria County is currently designated “unclassifiable.” EPA's intended redesignation of portions of these counties is based on modeled violations of the 2010 SO
                        <E T="52">2</E>
                         NAAQS. If the redesignation to nonattainment is finalized, the Commonwealth of Pennsylvania would be required to undertake certain planning requirements to reduce SO

                         concentrations within this area, including, but not limited to, the requirement to submit within 18 months of redesignation a revision to the Pennsylvania state implementation plan (SIP) that provides for attainment of the SO

During the public comment period for the proposed approval of the attainment SIP, the Sierra Club (in conjunction with the NPCA, PennFuture, Earthjustice, and the Council) submitted a modeling analysis using actual emissions and the critical emission values (CEVs)

The modeling used the same meteorological data, stack parameters, background concentrations and building downwash as Pennsylvania's attainment SIP for the Indiana Area. The Sierra Club modeling used emission inputs of actual historical emissions (2013–2018 quarter 1) and a finer receptor grid that included receptors outside Indiana County. When modeling 2015–2017 emissions, the resulting design value was 293.4 micrograms per cubic meter (ug/m

                </HD>
                <P>The CAA provides EPA with the authority to revise designations of, or “redesignate,” areas under CAA section 107(d)(3). Such redesignations can originate as requests by states (per CAA section 107(d)(3)(D)), and EPA can also notify a state at any time that a designation of any area or portion of an area should be revised, on the basis of air quality data, planning and control considerations, or any other air quality-related considerations the EPA Administrator deems appropriate. CAA section 107(d)(3)(A) further states that, “[i]n issuing such notification, which shall be public, to the Governor, the Administrator shall provide such information as the Administrator may have available explaining the basis for the notice.” The Act then requires the Governor to submit to EPA such redesignation, if any, as the Governor deems appropriate (CAA section 107(d)(3)(B)). CAA section 107(d)(3)(C) states that “the Administrator shall promulgate the redesignation, if any, of the area or portion thereof, submitted by the Governor in accordance with [CAA section 107(d)(3)(B)], making such modifications as the Administrator may deem necessary . . . . If the Governor does not submit, in accordance with [CAA section 107(d)(3)(B)], a redesignation for an area (or portion thereof) identified by the Administrator under [CAA section 107(d)(3)(A)], the Administrator shall promulgate such redesignation, if any, that the Administrator deems appropriate.”</P>
                <P>
                    As noted, CAA section 107(d)(3)(A) provides EPA latitude to consider a broad range of information in considering whether a designation should be revised. In consideration of “air quality data, planning and control considerations, or any other air quality-related considerations the EPA Administrator deems appropriate,” EPA has taken note of the analytical guidance that it has previously used in issuing initial area designations under CAA section 107(d)(1). EPA has issued multiple guidance documents for performing SO

EPA's detailed evaluation of the modeled violations, contributing sources, and intended area boundaries based on the weight of evidence of the previously identified factors are included in the TSD, which is located in the docket for this action. EPA's intended boundaries of the relevant area encompass Lower Yoder Township in Cambria County, Pennsylvania and St. Clair Township, Seward Borough, and New Florence Borough in Westmoreland County, Pennsylvania. A map showing the boundaries of our intended nonattainment area for Westmoreland and Cambria counties is included in the TSD.

                    <E T="52">2</E>
                     emissions from the Conemaugh and Seward plants, which are located in the existing Indiana, Pennsylvania nonattainment area. The attainment plan for the Indiana Area was partially disapproved and partially approved. This initiated a sanctions clock under CAA section 179, providing for emission offset sanctions for new sources unless Pennsylvania submits, and EPA fully approves, a revised attainment SIP for the Indiana Area within 18 months after the Agency's final partial disapproval, and providing for highway funding sanctions if EPA has not fully approved a revised plan within six months thereafter. Due to this unique situation and the already determined attainment planning schedule for the Indiana Area, EPA has decided not to add the proposed Westmoreland and Cambria nonattainment area into the existing Indiana Area. EPA maintains that under the circumstances presented here, a new nonattainment area that does not include the contributing sources is not an impediment to the Commonwealth's ability to impose new emission limits on the sources contributing to the air quality violations in the nonattainment area. In any future attainment plan submitted for this new area, Pennsylvania will need to demonstrate that any future emissions or new emission limits for Seward and Conemaugh are sufficient to provide for NAAQS attainment in both areas as a result of this redesignation. A discussion of the intended boundaries for the Westmoreland and Cambria nonattainment area is located in the TSD associated with this redesignation document. The TSD can be found at

Based on this information, EPA notified the Governor of Pennsylvania, in a letter dated February 17, 2023, of EPA's intention to redesignate portions of Westmoreland and Cambria counties to nonattainment. On June 22, 2023, Acting Secretary for the PA DEP, Richard Negrin, responded to EPA's letter but did not specify whether it agreed or disagreed with EPA's determination to redesignate portions of Westmoreland and Cambria counties as nonattainment for the 2010 SO

Framework 38 would implement measures to protect small scallops to support rotational access area trips to the fleet in future years. This action would also revise regulatory text that is unnecessary, outdated, or unclear. This action is necessary to prevent overfishing and improve both yield-per-recruit and the overall management of the Atlantic sea scallop resource.</P>

                <P>The scallop fishery's management unit ranges from the shorelines of Maine through North Carolina to the outer boundary of the Exclusive Economic Zone. The Atlantic Sea Scallop FMP, established in 1982, includes a number of amendments and framework adjustments that have revised and refined the fishery's management. The Council sets scallop fishery catch limits and other management measures through specification or framework adjustments that occur annually or biennially. The Council adopted Framework Adjustment 38 to the Atlantic Sea Scallop FMP on December 6, 2023. The Council submitted a draft of the framework, including a draft EA, for NMFS review and approval on December 22, 2023. This action proposes to approve and implement Framework 38, which establishes scallop specifications and other measures for fishing years 2024 and 2025, including changes to the catch, effort, and quota allocations and adjustments to the rotational area management program for fishing year 2024, and default specifications for fishing year 2025, as recommended by the Council.</P>
                <P>NMFS proposes to implement these Framework 38 measures as close as possible to the April 1 start of fishing year 2024. If NMFS implements these measures after the start of the fishing year, the default allocation measures currently established for fishing year 2024 will go into place on April 1, 2024. The Council reviewed the proposed regulations in this rule as drafted by NMFS and deemed them to be necessary and appropriate, as specified in section 303(c) of the Magnuson-Stevens Fishery Conservation and Management Act (Magnuson-Stevens Act).</P>
                <HD SOURCE="HD2">Specification of Scallop Overfishing Limit (OFL), Acceptable Biological Catch (ABC), Annual Catch Limits (ACL), Annual Catch Targets (ACT), Annual Projected Landings (APL) and Set-Asides for the 2024 Fishing Year, and Default Specifications for Fishing Year 2025</HD>
                <P>The Council set the proposed OFL based on a fishing mortality rate (F) of 0.61, equivalent to the F threshold updated through the Northeast Fisheries Science Center's most recent scallop benchmark stock assessment that was completed in September 2020. The proposed ABC and the equivalent total ACL for each fishing year are based on an F of 0.45, which is the F associated with a 25-percent probability of exceeding the OFL. The Council's Scientific and Statistical Committee (SSC) recommended scallop fishery ABCs of 47.4 million pounds (lb; 21,497 metric tons (mt)) for 2024 and 49.8 million lb (22,586 mt) for the 2025 fishing year, after accounting for discards and incidental mortality. The SSC will reevaluate and potentially adjust the ABC for 2025 when the Council develops the next framework adjustment.</P>
                <P>
                    Table 1 outlines the proposed scallop fishery catch limits. After deducting the incidental target total allowable catch (TAC), the research set-aside (RSA), and the observer set-aside, the remaining ACL available to the fishery is allocated according to the following fleet proportions established in Amendment 11 to the Atlantic Sea Scallop FMP (72 FR 20090; April 14, 2008): 94.5 percent is allocated to the limited access scallop fleet (
                    <E T="03">i.e.,</E>
                     the larger “trip boat” fleet); 5 percent is allocated to the limited access general category (LAGC) individual fishing quota (IFQ) fleet (
                    <E T="03">i.e.,</E>
                     the smaller “day boat” fleet); and the remaining 0.5 percent is allocated to limited access scallop vessels that also have LAGC IFQ permits. Amendment 15 (76 FR 43746; July 21, 2011) specified that buffers to account for management uncertainty are not necessary in setting the LAGC ACLs (
                    <E T="03">i.e.,</E>
                     the LAGC ACL is equal to the LAGC ACT). For the limited access fleet, the management uncertainty buffer is based on the F associated with a 75-percent probability of remaining below the F associated with ABC/ACL, which, using the updated Fs applied to the ABC/ACL, now results in an F of 0.39. Amendment 21 (87 FR 1688, January 12, 2023) modified the ACL flowchart to account for the scallop biomass in the Northern Gulf of Maine (NGOM) as part of the legal limits in the fishery by adding biomass from the area into calculations of the OFL and ABC. That action moved the accounting of the NGOM ACL from only within the OFL into the OFL and ABC/ACL for the entire fishery. In addition, Amendment 21 created the NGOM Set-Aside to support a directed LAGC fishery (including NGOM and LAGC IFQ permitted vessels) in the NGOM Management Area.

                <P>This action would deduct 1.275 million lb (578 mt) of scallops annually for 2024 and 2025 from the ABC for use as the Scallop RSA to fund scallop research. Vessels participating in the Scallop RSA are compensated through the sale of scallops harvested under RSA projects. Of the 1.275 million-lb (578-mt) allocation, NMFS has already allocated 125,941 lb (57,126 kg) to previously funded multi-year projects as part of the 2023 RSA awards process. NMFS is reviewing proposals submitted for consideration of 2024 RSA awards and will be selecting projects for funding in the near future.</P>
                <P>This action would also deduct one percent of the ABC for the industry-funded observer program to help defray the cost to scallop vessels that carry an observer. The observer set-aside is 473,994 lb (215 mt) for 2024 and 498,245 lb (226 mt) for 2025. The Council may adjust the 2025 observer set-aside when it develops specific, non-default measures for 2025.</P>

                    This action would implement vessel-specific DAS allocations for each of the three limited access scallop DAS permit categories (
                    <E T="03">i.e.,</E>
                     full-time, part-time, and occasional) for 2024 and 2025 (Table 2). Proposed 2024 DAS allocations are less than those allocated to the limited access fleet in 2023. Framework 38 would set 2025 DAS allocations at 75 percent of fishing year 2024 DAS allocations as a precautionary measure. This is to avoid over-allocating DAS to the fleet in the event that the 2025 specifications action is delayed past the start of the 2025 fishing year. The proposed allocations in table 2 exclude any DAS deductions that are required if the limited access scallop fleet exceeds its 2023 sub-ACL.

                <P>If NMFS implements these Framework 38 measures after the April 1 start of fishing year 2024, default DAS allocations, which were established in Framework Adjustment 36 to the Atlantic Sea Scallop FMP (88 FR 19559, April 3, 2023), would go into place on April 1, 2024. Under the default DAS allocations, full-time vessels would receive 18 DAS, part-time vessels would receive 7.20 DAS, and occasional vessels would receive 1.50 DAS. The allocations would later increase in accordance with Framework 38 when Framework 38 goes into effect. NMFS will notify all limited access permit holders of both default and Framework 38 DAS allocations so that vessel owners know what mid-year adjustments would occur should Framework 38 be approved and implemented after April 1, 2024.</P>

                <P>For fishing year 2024 and for the start of 2025, Framework 38 would combine and expand the boundaries of the Nantucket Lightship-West and Nantucket Lightship-North to form one area called the Nantucket Lightship Rotational Area (Table 3). This expanded area would be closed to better support rotational access in the future.</P>

                    For fishing year 2024 and the start of 2025, Framework 38 would divide Area I into three separate areas (
                    <E T="03">i.e.,</E>
                     Area I, Area I-Sliver, and Area I-Quad). Area I (Table 4) would be closed to the limited access fleet but would be available for LAGC IFQ fishing until the Regional Administrator has determined that the total number of LAGC IFQ access area trips have been or are projected to be taken. Area I-Sliver (Table 5) would remain closed to all scallop fishing to protect small scallops. Area I-Quad (Table 6) would also be closed to all scallop fishing to protect transplanted scallops related to an ongoing RSA project. The Area I-Quad closure would remain in place for one year, and then revert to being part of the Area I Rotational Area.

This area was previously managed as part of the area rotation program; however, there is not enough biomass to support rotational access, nor was there enough recruitment seen in the 2023 annual survey to support keeping this area as part of the program. Based on this information, it no longer meets the criteria for either closure or controlled access as defined in 50 CFR 648.55(a)(6).

                <P>Framework 38 would allow full-time limited access vessels to exchange access area allocation in 6,000-lb (2,722-kg) increments. The owner of a vessel issued a full-time limited access scallop permit would be able to exchange unharvested scallop pounds allocated into an access area for another full-time limited access vessel's unharvested scallop pounds allocated into another access area. For example, a full-time vessel may exchange 6,000 lb (2,722 kg) from one access area for 6,000 lb (2,722 kg) allocated to another full-time vessel for another access area. Further, a full-time vessel may exchange 12,000 lb (5,443 kg) from one access area for 12,000 lb (5,443 kg) allocated to another full-time vessel for another access area. These exchanges may be made only between vessels with the same permit category; a full-time vessel may not exchange allocations with a part-time vessel, and vice versa. Part-time vessels may not exchange access area allocations.</P>

                <P>Framework 38 would require that all scallop vessels with active VMS units be subject to constant reporting at 5-minute intervals when seaward of the VMS demarcation line on a federal scallop declaration. When inshore of the VMS demarcation line, vessels would report at a 30-minute interval. The increased VMS reporting rate is not intended to apply to vessels participating in state-waters scallop fisheries and excludes any scallop trip associated with the scallop state water exemption program. VMS is used in the scallop fishery as an enforcement and management tool. Increasing the VMS reporting rate to 5 minutes on declared scallop trips would improve enforcement of access area and closure boundaries by substantially reducing the window in which a vessel could enter or fish a closed area or access area undetected. VMS is also an important source of fishery effort data for the scallop fishery. Increasing the VMS reporting rate in the scallop fishery would improve data quality by increasing the spatial resolution of the data, which could lead to more effective management and enforcement.</P>
                <HD SOURCE="HD2">Prohibition on Transiting Scallop Rotational Areas and the Western Gulf of Maine Closure</HD>
                <P>To better enforce the Sea Scallop Rotational Area Management Program, Framework 38 would prohibit all vessels fishing under a scallop declaration from entering or transiting any scallop rotational areas (unless the vessel is on a declared trip into that area, or otherwise specified) and the Western Gulf of Maine Closure Area. For fishing year 2024, the Area I (table 4) and the Area I-Quad (table 6) Scallop Rotational Areas would be corridors for continuous transiting, and transit would be permitted. Continuous transit means that a vessel has fishing gear stowed and not available for immediate use and travels through an area with a direct heading, consistent with navigational safety, while maintaining expeditious headway throughout the transit without loitering or delay. Prohibiting vessels on declared scallop trips from entering or transiting scallop rotational areas (unless otherwise specified) and the Western Gulf of Maine Closure Area would reduce the likelihood of fishing occurring inside these areas.</P>

                     This action would implement a 2.26 million-lb (1,024-mt ACL for 2024 and a 2.40 million-lb (1,089-mt) default ACL for 2025 for LAGC vessels with IFQ-only permits (see table 1). These sub-ACLs have no associated regulatory or management requirements but provide a ceiling on overall landings by the LAGC IFQ fleets. If the fleet were to reach this ceiling, any overages would be deducted from the following year's sub-ACL. Framework 28 (82 FR 15155; March 27, 2017) changed the way the LAGC IFQ allocations are set from a direct percentage of the ACL to a percentage of the APL. The purpose of this change was to help ensure that the allocation of potential catch between the fleets is more consistent with the concept of spatial management by allocating catch to the LAGC IFQ fleet based on harvestable scallops instead of total biomass. Since Framework 28 was implemented in 2017, the LAGC IFQ allocation has been equal to 5.5 percent of the projected landings (5 percent for LAGC IFQ vessels and 0.5 percent for LAGC IFQ vessels that also have a limited access scallop permit). The annual allocation to the LAGC IFQ-only fleet for fishing years 2024 and 2025 based on APL would be 1.28 million lb (580 mt) for 2024 and 959,011 lb (435 mt) for 2025 (see table 1).

These sub-ACLs have no associated regulatory or management requirements but provide a ceiling on overall landings by this fleet. If the fleet were to reach this ceiling, any overages would be deducted from the following year's sub-ACL. The annual allocation to limited access vessels with IFQ permits would be 127,868 lb (58 mt) for 2024 and 97,003 lb (44 mt) for 2025 (see table 1).

                     This action proposes a 50,000-lb (22,680-kg) scallop incidental landings target TAL for fishing years 2024 and 2025 to account for mortality from vessels that catch scallops while fishing for other species and ensure that F targets are not exceeded. The Council and NMFS may adjust this target TAC in a future action if vessels catch more scallops under the incidental target TAC than predicted.

                <P>This action allows vessels participating in RSA projects to harvest RSA compensation from the open area and the Area II Scallop Rotational Area. All vessels are prohibited from harvesting RSA compensation pounds in all other access areas. Vessels are prohibited from fishing for RSA compensation in the NGOM unless the vessel is fishing on an RSA compensation trip using NGOM RSA allocation that was awarded to an RSA project. Lastly, Framework 38 prohibits the harvest of RSA from any rotational area under default 2025 measures. At the start of 2025, RSA compensation may only be harvested from open areas. The Council will re-evaluate this default prohibition measure in the action that would set final 2025 specifications.</P>

                <P>This proposed rule includes one revision to address regulatory text that is unnecessary, outdated, and unclear. This revision to § 648.64(f)(2) would fix an error and clarify that the Northern Windowpane Flounder Gear Restricted Area shall remain in effect for the period of time based on the corresponding percent overage of the northern windowpane flounder sub-ACL.</P>
                <P>In addition, this proposed rule includes changes to regulatory text in § 648.11 that are required to update the industry-funded observer program to the Pre-Trip Notification System (PTNS). The integration of the scallop notification requirement into the PTNS helps standardize observer operations between fisheries and modernize reporting systems. The PTNS is a mobile-friendly website that is more sophisticated and flexible than the aging interactive voice response technology. The change to the PTNS does not affect determination of scallop coverage rates or the compensation analysis. There are no changes to the requirements vessels must abide by if selected to carry an observer, such as equal accommodations, a harassment-free environment, and other safety requirements.

                <P>These revisions are consistent with section 305(d) of the Magnuson-Stevens Act, which provides authority to the Secretary of Commerce to promulgate regulations necessary to ensure that amendments to the Atlantic Sea Scallop FMP are carried out in accordance with the Atlantic Sea Scallop FMP and the Magnuson-Stevens Act.</P>
                <HD SOURCE="HD1">Classification</HD>
                <P>NMFS is proposing these annual specifications and management measure changes pursuant to section 304(b)(1)(A) of the Magnuson-Stevens Act, which provides specific authority for implementing this action. Pursuant to section 305(d) of the Magnuson-Steven Act, this action is necessary to carry out the Atlantic Sea Scallop FMP by allowing NMFS to implement measures developed in Framework Adjustment 38 to the Atlantic Sea Scallop FMP for fishing year 2024. The NMFS Assistant Administrator has determined that this proposed rule is consistent with the Atlantic Sea Scallop FMP and other applicable law, subject to further consideration after public comment.</P>
                <P>
                    NMFS finds that a 15-day comment period for this action provides a reasonable opportunity for public 
                    <PRTPAGE P="9825"/>
                    participation in this action pursuant to Administrative Procedure Act section 553(c) (5 U.S.C. 553(c)), while also ensuring that the final specifications are in place for the start of the Atlantic sea scallop fishing year on April 1, 2024. The Council adopted Framework 38 to the Atlantic Sea Scallop FMP on December 6, 2023, and submitted a preliminary draft of the framework on December 22, 2023. NMFS has taken all diligent steps to promulgate this rule as quickly as possible but could not have published the rule sooner because the data necessary for the Council to develop the framework was not yet available. Stakeholder and industry groups have been involved with the development of this action and have participated in public meetings throughout the past year.
                </P>
                <P>If this action is not implemented by April 1, 2024, it would delay positive economic benefits to the scallop fleet, could negatively impact the access area rotation program by delaying fishing in areas that should be available, could adversely affect scallop stocks by delaying harvest when scallop meats are smaller resulting in increased mortality, and could create confusion in the Atlantic sea scallop industry. A 15-day comment period is reasonable because the rule is not complex, it implements an FMP that underwent a full comment period, there is a pending deadline of April 1, 2024, before default specification goes into effect, and failing to implement Framework 38 by that deadline would have adverse consequences for the public.</P>
                <P>While NMFS is not waiving the comment period in its entirety, a 30-comment period would likely delay implementation of Framework 38 and trigger the 2024 default specifications from Framework 36. If Framework 38 is delayed beyond April 1, 2024, certain default measures, including access area designations, DAS, IFQ, RSA, and observer set-aside allocations, would automatically be put into place. Most of these default allocations are set at lower harvest levels than what would be implemented under Framework 38. These default allocations were intentionally set at levels low enough to avoid exceeding the final Framework 38 allocations. Framework 38 would increase allocations throughout the fleet. Under default measures, each full-time vessel has 18 DAS and no access area trips. The specification measures in Framework 38 would provide full-time vessels with an additional 2 DAS (20 DAS total) and 36,000 lb (16,329 kg) in access area allocations. Framework 38 also would open the New York Bight Access Area allowing the fleet to sustainably fish in the area. Accordingly, this action also prevents more restrictive aspects of the default measures from going into effect.</P>
                <P>This proposed rule has been determined to be not significant for purposes of Executive Order 12866.</P>

                <P>
                    The proposed regulations would affect all vessels with limited access, LAGC IFQ, and LAGC NGOM scallop permits. Framework 38 (section 5.6) and the LAGC IFQ Performance Evaluation (2017) provide extensive information on the number of vessels that would be affected by the proposed regulations, their home and principal state, dependency on the scallop fishery, and revenues and profits (see 
                    <E T="02">ADDRESSES</E>
                    ). There were 307 vessels that held full-time limited access permits in fishing year 2022, including 244 dredge, 53 small-dredge, and 10 scallop trawl permits. In the same year, there were also 27 part-time limited access permits in the sea scallop fishery. No vessels were issued occasional scallop permits in 2022. In 2019, NMFS reported that there were a total of 300 IFQ-only permits, with 212 issued and 88 in Confirmation of Permit History. Approximately 96 of the IFQ vessels and 78 NGOM vessels actively fished for scallops in fishing year 2022. The remaining IFQ permits likely leased out scallop IFQ allocations with their permits in Confirmation of Permit History. Thirty-eight limited access vessels also held LAGC IFQ permits, 52 had NGOM permits, and 102 had incidental permits.
                </P>
                <P>For RFA purposes, NMFS defines a small business in a shellfish fishery as a firm that is independently owned and operated with receipts of less than $11 million annually (see 50 CFR 200.2). Individually permitted vessels may hold permits for several fisheries, harvesting species of fish that are regulated by several different fishery management plans, even beyond those impacted by the proposed action. Furthermore, multiple permitted vessels and/or permits may be owned by entities affiliated through stock ownership, common management, identity of interest, contractual relationships, or economic dependency. For the purposes of this analysis, “ownership entities” are defined as those entities with common ownership as listed on the permit application. Only permits with identical ownership are categorized as an “ownership entity.” For example, if five permits have the same seven persons listed as co-owners on their permit applications, those seven persons would form one “ownership entity,” that holds those five permits. If two of those seven owners also co-own additional vessels, that ownership arrangement would be considered a separate “ownership entity” for the purpose of this analysis.</P>
                <P>
                    On June 1 of each year, ownership entities are identified based on a list of all permits for the most recent complete calendar year. The current ownership dataset is based on the calendar year 2022 permits and contains average gross sales associated with those permits for calendar years 2018 through 2022. Matching the potentially impacted 2022 fishing year permits described above (
                    <E T="03">i.e.,</E>
                     limited access and LAGC IFQ) to calendar year 2022 ownership data results in 150 distinct ownership entities for the limited access fleet and 77 distinct ownership entities for the LAGC IFQ fleet. Based on the Small Business Administration (SBA) 
                    <PRTPAGE P="9826"/>
                    guidelines, 142 of the limited access distinct ownership entities and 87 LAGC IFQ entities are categorized as small business entities. Eight limited access and none of the LAGC IFQ entities are categorized as large business entities with annual fishing revenues over $11 million in 2022. There were 73 distinct small business entities with NGOM permits in 2022.

                <HD SOURCE="HD2">Description of Significant Alternatives to the Proposed Action Which Accomplish the Stated Objectives of Applicable Statutes and Which Minimize Any Significant Economic Impact on Small Entities</HD>
                <P>
                    The Council's preferred alternative (section 4.3.3) in Framework 38 (see 
                    <E T="02">ADDRESSES</E>
                    ) would allocate each full-time limited access vessel 20 open area DAS and 3 access area trips (
                    <E T="03">i.e.,</E>
                     2 Area II trips at 12,000 lb (5,443 kg) and 1 New York Bight trip at 12,000 lb (5,443 kg)) amounting to 36,000 lb (16,329 kg) in fishing year 2024. This is estimated to result in about 25.596 million lb (11,610 mt) of APLs after research and observer set asides are accounted for. The limited access share of 94.5 percent is around 24.18 million lb (10,792 mt) (table 14). The LAGC IFQ share (
                    <E T="03">i.e.,</E>
                     5.5 percent allocation for both IFQ only and limited access vessels with IFQ permits) will be about 1.407 million lb (638 mt) (section 4.4.2, table 15). Total landings, including set-asides to support research and observer coverage is projected to be about 27.39 million lb (12,423 mt) (table 13).
                </P>
                <P>
                    The preferred alternative (section 4.3.3) is expected to have negative impacts on the net revenues and profits of small entities regulated by this action in fishing year 2024 (
                    <E T="03">i.e.,</E>
                     Framework 38) compared to the fishing year 2023 (
                    <E T="03">i.e.,</E>
                     Framework 36) scenario. The decline in revenue per entity between fishing year 2023 levels and fishing year 2024 is a result of a decline in scallop prices for these fishing years despite higher projected landings in Framework 38 relative to Framework 36. Projected landings for limited access fleet are expected to increase by about 1.325 million lb (601 mt) under the Framework 38 preferred alternative compared to the Framework 36 preferred alternative.
                </P>
                <P>Under the Framework 38 preferred alternative (section 4.3.3), allocations for the LAGC IFQ fishery, including the limited access vessels with IFQ permits, will be about 12 percent higher than the allocation that was implemented for fishing year 2023 under Framework 36. In terms of net revenue, this difference is expected to be of similar magnitude and negative for the preferred alternative relative to fishing year 2023 levels. Therefore, the Framework 38 preferred alternative will have slightly negative or negligible economic impacts on the LAGC IFQ fishery compared to fishing year 2023 levels due to a recent decline in scallop prices (table 15).</P>
                <P>
                    The economic benefits of all the alternatives considered in Framework 38, including the proposed alternative, will exceed economic benefits of No Action. The specification alternatives considered in Framework 38 slightly differ across alternatives with each alternative allocating to the same access area allocations. Differences between the alternatives are driven by the number of DAS allocated, which ranges from 18 to 24 DAS and the trip limit in access areas is fixed at 12,000 lb (5,443 kg). The Council's preferred alternative, alternative 3 (section 4.3.3) (see 
                    <E T="02">ADDRESSES</E>
                    ) would result in a higher allocation to the limited access and LAGC IFQ components in 2024. This is expected to result in lower revenues compared to Framework 36 preferred alternative in fishing year 2023 primarily due to lower expected price during Framework 38 relative to Framework 36 (table 14 and table 15). The percent change in net revenue per business entity for all Framework 38 alternatives is expected to decline by 2.3 percent to 12.28 percent compared to the Framework 36 preferred alternative. Under the preferred alternative in Framework 38, net revenues per entity with limited access permits are estimated to be below fishing year 2023 levels by about 8.6 percent in fishing year 2024 (table 14).
                </P>
                <P>The Council considered 4 NGOM TAL options for fishing year 2024 that ranged from 396,391 lb (179,800 kg) (option 1) to 527,346 lb (239,200 kg) (option 3). All TAL options would result in higher revenues compared to No Action, which are default measures set in Framework 36 for fishing year 2024. The preferred alternative (alternative 2, option 2) would have a slightly higher TAL (454,152 lb, 206,000 kg) and revenue compared to the alternative 2 (option 1), but lower revenues than alternative 2 (option 3). When compared to No Action, the higher TAL of alternative 2 (option 2) would also result in higher revenues and economic benefits for entities in this fishery with an estimated increase in net revenues by about 47 percent compared to No Action (table 16).</P>
                <P>Under the sharing arrangement approved for the NGOM Management Area in Amendment 21, Framework 38 would not allocate pounds to the LAGC IFQ or limited access components for fishing year 2024 because the NGOM set-aside did not exceed 800,000 lb (362,874 kg). Therefore, Action 2 would not have direct impacts on the limited access component. More research is planned for this area in 2024, which will help to increase the understanding of biomass in the NGOM management area. This will lead to better management of the NGOM resource with positive biological and economic impacts over the long-term on both LAGC and limited access vessels.</P>
                <P>
                    Economic impacts of Framework 38 preferred alternatives, including fishery specifications, access area trip allocations for the limited access and LAGC IFQ fisheries, NGOM measures, and other measures to reduce fishery impacts are expected to be slightly negative for the scallop vessels and small business entities compared to the fishing year 2023 baseline implemented through Framework 36. This is primarily due to a decline in the projected price. There are eight large entities in the limited access component of the scallop fishery and impacts on scallop revenues to small entities would not be disproportionate. All entities would be impacted in a similar way from a higher projected landing allocation. A slight negative or negligible economic impact in Framework 38 compared to Framework 36 is primarily due to a decline in scallop prices rather than changes in projected landings between these frameworks. We have determined that the preferred alternative is nevertheless optimal because it would minimize risks associated with stock biomass uncertainties while protecting small scallops and minimizing bycatch of species such as yellowtail and windowpane flounder. Furthermore, the preferred alternative intentionally leaves biomass in the water to increase the likelihood that a similar DAS allocation and associated F rate, along with access area fishing will be available for the following fishing year.

                         A negative sign indicates a lower value for a Framework 38 alternative compared to the Framework 36 preferred alternative and vice versa.

                    <TNOTE>* Note that Framework 36 and Framework 38 are evaluated at different prices, and price variability may swing wildly for various reasons affecting the economic comparisons between the two frameworks. In such a case, preferred alternative comparison with status quo in the current framework would be more relevant.</TNOTE>

To facilitate the deployment of at-sea observers, all sea scallop vessels issued limited access, LAGC IFQ, and LAGC NGOM permits are required to comply with the additional notification requirements specified in paragraph (k)(2) of this section. When NMFS informs the vessel owner, operator, and/or manager of any requirement to carry an observer on a specified trip in either an Access Area, Open Area, or NGOM as specified in paragraph (k)(3) of this section, the vessel may not fish for, take, retain, possess, or land any scallops without carrying an observer. Vessels may only embark on a scallop trip without an observer if the vessel owner, operator, and/or manager has been informed that the vessel has received a waiver of the observer requirement for that trip pursuant to paragraphs (k)(3) of this section.

                         Based on predetermined coverage levels for various permit categories and areas of the scallop fishery that are provided by NMFS in writing to all observer service providers approved pursuant to 
                        <PRTPAGE P="9829"/>
                        paragraph (h) of this section, NMFS shall inform the vessel owner, operator, or vessel manager whether the vessel must carry an observer, or if a waiver has been granted, for the specified scallop trip, at least 24 hr prior to the PTNS sail time of that trip notification. All assignments and waivers of observer coverage shall be issued to the vessel. A vessel may not fish in an area with an observer waiver confirmation number that does not match the scallop trip plan that was submitted to NMFS. PTNS notifications that are canceled are not considered active notifications, and a vessel may not sail on a Federal scallop trip on a canceled notification.

                        (i) An owner of a scallop vessel required to carry an observer under paragraph (k)(3) of this section must carry an observer that has passed a NMFS-certified Observer Training class certified by NMFS from an observer service provider approved by NMFS under paragraph (h) of this section. The PTNS will offer selected trips to approved observer service providers in a manner that will take into account the vessels' provider preferences, but final outcomes will be dependent on the observer availability of each provider. The PTNS will inform the owner, operator, or vessel manager of a trip's selection outcome between 48 and 24 hours prior to the PTNS sail time. The PTNS will specify the trip's outcome (
                        <E T="03">i.e.,</E>
                         selection to carry an observer or a waiver), as well as which provider has been assigned to provide any required coverage along with their contact information. Vessels shall communicate trip details with the assigned observer provider company within a reasonable timeframe after the provider has been assigned. A list of approved observer service providers shall be posted on the NMFS/FSB website: 
                        <E T="03">https://www.fisheries.noaa.gov/resource/data/observer-providers-northeast-and-mid-atlantic-programs.</E>
                         Observers are not required to be available earlier than the PTNS sail time for that trip notification. Unless otherwise determined by the Regional Administrator or their delegate, if an observer is not available for a trip, providers will indicate as such in the PTNS, and the trip will be waived of the coverage requirement, as appropriate. Upon initial selection, providers will indicate their availability to cover a trip between 48 and 24 hours prior to the PTNS sail time for that trip notification, however extenuating circumstances impacting the observer's availability (
                        <E T="03">e.g.,</E>
                         illness or transportation issues) may result in a waiver within 24 hours of the vessel's sail time. A vessel of any eligible permit type may not begin a selected trip without the assigned observer unless having been issued a waiver.

                         On a declared scallop trip, a vessel issued any Federal scallop permit may not enter, transit, fish for, possess, or land scallops in or from a Scallop Rotational Area unless it is participating in, and complies with, the Scallop Access Area Program Requirements defined in paragraphs (b) through (g) of this section, or if the vessel is transiting a Scallop Rotational Area defined as “available for continuous transit” pursuant to paragraph (a)(2) of this section. On a trip declared out of the Federal scallop fishery, a vessel may fish for species other than scallops within the rotational closed areas, provided the vessel does not fish for, catch, possess, or retain scallops or intend to fish for, catch, possess, or retain scallops.

Exchange forms are available from the Regional Administrator upon request. Each vessel owner involved in an exchange is required to submit a completed Access Area Allocation Form. The Regional Administrator shall review the records for each vessel to confirm that each vessel has enough unharvested allocation remaining in a given access area to exchange. The exchange is not effective until the vessel owner(s) receive a confirmation in writing from the Regional Administrator that the allocation exchange has been made effective. A vessel owner may exchange equal allocations in 6,000 lb (2,722 kg) increments between two or more vessels of the same permit category under his/her ownership. A vessel owner holding a Confirmation of Permit History is not eligible to exchange allocations between another vessel and the vessel for which a Confirmation of Permit History has been issued.

                <P>The Draft PEA analyzes and discloses the potential environmental impacts associated with the establishment of the Resilient Food Systems Infrastructure (RFSI) Program. The United States Department of Agriculture (USDA) Agriculture Marketing Service (AMS) has proposed to fund cooperative agreements to coordinate initiatives for non-meat and poultry food products in the middle of the supply chain. Funds will support expanded capacity for the aggregation, processing, manufacturing, storing, transporting, wholesaling, and distribution of locally and regionally produced food products, including specialty crops, dairy, grains for human consumption, aquaculture, and other food products, excluding meat and poultry.</P>
                <P>States will make subawards to support local and regional food and farm businesses and other entities. States will also provide supply chain and market development services. Through these efforts, the RFSI program aims to enhance market access for small and mid-size producers and food businesses, contributing to a more resilient and sustainable food system.</P>
                <P>The RFSI Program is authorized by section 1001 (b)(4) of the American Rescue Plan Act (ARPA) (Pub. L. 117–2), which funds “loans and grants and other assistance to maintain and improve food and agricultural supply chain resiliency.” Recipients of funding from this proposed program would be allowed 48 months to complete work funded by the awards.</P>
                <P>The environmental impacts of funding projects to expand capacity for the aggregation, processing, manufacturing, storing, transporting, wholesaling, and distribution of locally and regionally produced, non-meat and poultry food products and provide supply chain and market development services have been considered in a manner consistent with the provisions of the National Environmental Policy Act (NEPA) of 1969, Public Law 91–190, 42 U.S.C. 4321–4347, as amended.</P>
                <P>A Draft PEA has been prepared, and based on this analysis, AMS has preliminarily determined there will not be a significant impact to the human environment. As a result, an Environmental Impact Statement (EIS) has not been initiated (40 CFR 1501.6). AMS intends for this PEA to create efficiencies by establishing a framework that can be used for “tiering,” where appropriate, to project-specific actions that require additional analysis. As decisions on specific applications are made, to the extent additional NEPA analysis is required, environmental review will be conducted to supplement the analysis set forth in this PEA.</P>
                <P>
                    The Draft PEA is available for review online at the program website: 
                    <E T="03">https://www.ams.usda.gov/services/grants/rfsi.</E>

                    <E T="02">ADDRESSES</E>
                     section of this Notice. The most helpful comments reference a specific recommendation for changing AMS' proposed approach to assessing environmental impacts, explain the reason for any recommended change, and include supporting information. AMS will consider all comments received on or before the closing date.

                    As stated above, on February 5, 2024, in accordance with section 735(d) of the Act, the ITC notified Commerce of its final determination in this investigation in which it found that an industry in the United States is materially injured within the meaning of section 735(b)(1)(A)(i) of the Act by reason of imports of pressure washers from China that are sold at LTFV.

                     Therefore, in accordance with section 735(c)(2) and 736 of the Act, Commerce is issuing this AD order. Because the ITC determined that imports of pressure washers from China are materially injuring a U.S. industry, unliquidated entries of such merchandise from China, entered or withdrawn from warehouse for consumption, are subject to the assessment of antidumping duties.

Antidumping duties will be assessed on unliquidated entries of pressure washers from China entered, or withdrawn from warehouse, for consumption, on or after August 3, 2023, the date of publication of the

                    Therefore, in accordance with section 703(d) of the Act, we instructed CBP to terminate the suspension of liquidation and to liquidate, without regard to countervailing duties, unliquidated entries of pressure washers from China entered, or withdrawn from warehouse, for consumption, on or after October 2, 2023, the date on which the provisional measures expired, until and through the day preceding the date of publication of the ITC's final injury determination in the

                    <P>The power washers subject to these orders have an unfinished and/or unassembled cold water gas powered pressure washer consists of, at a minimum, the power unit or components of the power unit, packaged or imported together. Importation of the power unit whether or not accompanied by, or attached to, additional components including, but not limited to a frame, spray guns, hoses, lances, and nozzles constitutes an unfinished cold water gas powered pressure washer for purposes of this scope. The inclusion in a third country of any components other than the power unit does not remove the cold water gas powered pressure washer from the scope. A cold water gas powered pressure washer is within the scope of these orders regardless of the origin of its engine. Subject merchandise also includes finished and unfinished cold water gas powered pressure washers that are further processed in a third country or in the United States, including, but not limited to, assembly or any other processing that would not otherwise remove the merchandise from the scope of these orders if performed in the country of manufacture of the in-scope cold water gas powered pressure washers.</P>
                    <P>The scope excludes hot water gas powered pressure washers, which are pressure washers that include a heating element used to heat the water sprayed from the machine.</P>

                <P>The Northeast Multispecies Fishery Management Plan includes a requirement for industry-funded monitoring of catch by sector vessels. NMFS approves independent third-party service providers with which sectors may contract to provide ASM and/or EM services to their vessels. NMFS requires full applications for approval from ASM and EM companies that are not currently approved to be a service provider. Previously approved ASM and EM companies are not required to submit a full application to maintain their approval status if they continue to meet all service provider performance standards and submit required updated information annually. The required updated information to maintain approval includes an updated Emergency Action Plan, evidence of adequate insurance coverage, and, if applicable, any updates to staffing or operations. Regulations at 50 CFR 648.11(h) describe the criteria for approval of ASM and EM service provider applications. NMFS approves service providers based on: (1) Completeness and sufficiency of applications; and (2) determination of the applicant's ability to meet the performance requirements of a sector monitoring service provider. Once approved, service providers must meet specified performance requirements outlined in § 648.11(h)(5) and (6), including required coverage levels, in order to maintain eligibility. NMFS must notify service providers, in writing, if NMFS withdraws approval for any reason.</P>

                <P>On September 28, 2023, NMFS announced an opportunity for new monitoring companies to apply for approval to provide ASM and/or EM services in fishing year 2024, and an opportunity for currently approved providers to submit updated documentation to maintain their approval status in fishing year 2024. NMFS previously approved nine companies to provide catch monitoring services to the Northeast multispecies sectors in fishing year 2023. Five of the nine approved companies provide both ASM and EM services: A.I.S., Inc.; East West Technical Services, LLC; Fathom Research, LLC; New England Marine Monitoring; and Saltwater, Inc. The other four approved companies provide EM services only: Archipelago Marine Research, Ltd.; Flywire Cameras; Satlink US, LLC; and Teem Fish Monitoring, Inc.</P>
                <P>All currently approved ASM and EM companies continue to meet all service provider performance standards, submitted all required documentation, and are therefore approved service providers for fishing year 2024. We did not receive any new ASM or EM provider applications. Table 1 includes the revised list of approved monitoring service providers.</P>
                <P>NMFS has the authority to remove a service provider from its approved status in accordance with the regulations at § 648.11(h)(7). A monitoring service provider that fails to meet the requirements, conditions, and responsibilities will be notified in writing that it is subject to removal from the list of approved monitoring service providers. Withdrawing approval of a service provider will be based on an evaluation of the service providers ability to meet the third-party catch monitoring provider standards in § 648.11(h)(5) and (6). NMFS will closely monitor the performance of approved service providers, and will withdraw approval during the current approval term if it determines performance standards are not being met.</P>
                <P>NMFS did not solicit applications to provide dockside monitoring (DSM) services related to the maximized retention EM program. NMFS is currently evaluating whether to operate the maximized retention EM program in fishing year 2024. NMFS will continue to administer the DSM program if it is operational in fishing year 2024. In future fishing years, NMFS intends to solicit applications to be an approved DSM provider when the DSM program transitions to industry-funding.</P>

                <P>j. On December 6, 2023, Commission staff issued a letter providing Marlow Hydro with details regarding the process for filing a license application for the Nash Mill Project. As stated above, on June 20, 2023, Marlow Hydro filed a notice of withdrawal of a surrender application for the Nash Mill Project and a request to return to a licensing process. The request to reinstate the subsequent licensing proceeding was denied. Staff determined, however, (1) that the pre-filing work (Pre-Application Document request, and approval, to use the TLP, and Joint Agency Meeting) performed by Marlow Hydro satisfies the requirements of 18 CFR 4.38(b) for first stage consultation; (2) that Marlow Hydro should proceed with second stage consultation; and (3) that the June 20, 2023 notice of withdrawal of the surrender application should serve as a notice of intent to file an original license application for the Nash Mill Project (see paragraph g).</P>
                <P>
                    k. There typically is no filing deadline for an original license application. However, Marlow Hydro is currently operating the project under section 18 CFR 16.21(a) of the Commission's regulations authorizing it to operate the project until the Commission acts on its application (see the 
                    <E T="03">Notice of Authorization for Continued Project Operation</E>
                     issued on December 22, 2022). Thus, to ensure that Marlow Hydro files a timely application for the Commission to act on, establishing a deadline for Marlow Hydro's original license application is warranted. Staff has determined that it is reasonable to expect second stage consultation and a final license application to be completed by the end of July of 2024. Therefore, the final license application for this project is due by July 31, 2024.

                <SUBJECT>Double E Pipeline, LLC; Notice of Request for Extension of Time</SUBJECT>
                <P>Take notice that on January 31, 2024, Double E Pipeline, LLC. (Double E) requested that the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission (Commission) grant an extension of time, until February 18, 2025, to complete construction and place into service the Red Hills Lateral Project (Project) located in Eddy and Lea Counties, New Mexico. On December 19, 2022, the Commission issued a Notice of Request Under Blanket Authorization, which established a 60-day comment period, ending on February 17, 2023, to file protests. No protests were filed during the comment period, and accordingly the project was authorized on February 18, 2023, and by Rule should have been completed within one year.</P>
                <P>In its 2024 Extension of Time Request, Double E states that pre-construction activities are ongoing, but that it will not complete all work associated with the Project by the February 18, 2024, deadline. Accordingly, Double E requests an extension of time until February 18, 2025, to complete construction of project facilities.</P>
                <P>
                    This notice establishes a 15-calendar day intervention and comment period 
                    <PRTPAGE P="9847"/>
                    deadline. Any person wishing to comment on Double E's request for an extension of time may do so. No reply comments or answers will be considered. If you wish to obtain legal status by becoming a party to the proceedings for this request, you should, on or before the comment date stated below, file a motion to intervene in accordance with the requirements of the Commission's Rules of Practice and Procedure (18 CFR 385.214 or 385.211) and the Regulations under the Natural Gas Act (18 CFR 157.10).
                </P>
                <P>
                    As a matter of practice, the Commission itself generally acts on requests for extensions of time to complete construction for NGA facilities when such requests are contested before order issuance. For those extension requests that are contested,
                    <SU>1</SU>
                    <FTREF/>
                     the Commission will aim to issue an order acting on the request within 45 days.
                    <SU>2</SU>
                    <FTREF/>
                     The Commission will address all arguments relating to whether the applicant has demonstrated there is good cause to grant the extension.
                    <SU>3</SU>
                    <FTREF/>
                     The Commission will not consider arguments that re-litigate the issuance of the certificate order, including whether the Commission properly found the project to be in the public convenience and necessity and whether the Commission's environmental analysis for the certificate complied with the National Environmental Policy Act (NEPA).
                    <SU>4</SU>
                    <FTREF/>
                     At the time a pipeline requests an extension of time, orders on certificates of public convenience and necessity are final and the Commission will not re-litigate their issuance.
                    <SU>5</SU>
                    <FTREF/>
                     The Director of the Office of Energy Projects, or his or her designee, will act on all of those extension requests that are uncontested.

                     Indoor AirPlus is aimed at forming public-private partnerships that help prevent various forms of indoor air pollution and their associated health risks. This ICR covers information collection activities under the EPA's newly revised Indoor AirPlus program. Indoor AirPlus is a voluntary certification labeling program that represents value-added marketability that home builders, verification companies, and oversight organizations can use to distinguish themselves from competition, while homeowners see a healthier and safer home with improved indoor air quality (IAQ) by requiring construction practices and product specifications that minimize exposure to airborne pollutants and contaminants.

                     The State PREP has mandatory, formula allotments for state and territories to apply. The process is for states and territories to submit and for ACYF/FYSB to collect their state plans and semi-annual performance progress reports.
                </P>
                <P>
                    <E T="03">Purpose and Use of the Information Collection:</E>
                     The state plan offers information about the proposed state project and has been and will continue to be used as the primary basis to determine whether or not the project meets the minimum requirements of the legislation for the grant award. There are no changes proposed to the state plan; FYSB is requesting to use these plans for another 3 years.
                </P>
                <P>The Performance Progress Reports are collected semi-annually and inform the monitoring of the grantees' program design, program evaluation, management improvement, service quality, and compliance with agreed upon goals. ACYF/FYSB has used and will continue to use the information to ensure effective service delivery for program participants. Finally, the data from this collection will be used to report outcomes and efficiencies and will provide valuable information to policy makers and key stakeholders in the development of program and research efforts. Changes are proposed to the Performance Progress Reports and include the addition of information related to equity activities and strategies to mitigate challenges. Information on equity activities will be used to support the FYSB Equity Action Plan objectives and to inform the development of T&amp;TA resources, as needed. The purpose of including strategies to mitigate challenges is to allow grant recipients to demonstrate how they overcome challenges. This information can be used to inform peer to peer sharing.</P>

                        The Food and Drug Administration (FDA or we) is announcing the availability of a draft guidance for industry entitled “Recommendations for Collecting Representative Samples for Food Testing Used as Evidence for Release of Certain Fish and Fishery Products Subject to Detention Without Physical Examination (DWPE) and Removal of a Foreign Manufacturer's Goods from DWPE.” The draft guidance, when finalized, will provide recommendations for collecting a representative sample for products subject to DWPE under an import alert

                        due to the appearance of adulteration caused by pathogens, unlawful animal drugs, scombrotoxin (histamine), and/or decomposition. When finalized, the draft guidance will also help foreign manufacturers and other processors of fish and fishery products subject to DWPE introduce evidence to FDA to support a request to have products removed from DWPE.

                <HD SOURCE="HD1">I. Background</HD>
                <P>We are announcing the availability of a draft guidance for industry entitled “Recommendations for Collecting Representative Samples for Food Testing Used as Evidence for Release of Certain Fish and Fishery Products Subject to Detention Without Physical Examination (DWPE) and Removal of a Foreign Manufacturer's Goods from DWPE.” We are issuing the draft guidance consistent with our good guidance practices regulation (21 CFR 10.115). The draft guidance, when finalized, will represent the current thinking of FDA on this topic. It does not establish any rights for any person and is not binding on FDA or the public. You can use an alternate approach if it satisfies the requirements of the applicable statutes and regulations.</P>
                <P>Under section 801(a)(3) of the Federal Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act (FD&amp;C Act) (21 U.S.C. 381(a)(3)), an article of food imported or offered for import into the United States is subject to refusal of admission if it appears “from the examination of such samples or otherwise” to be adulterated. FDA issues import alerts to inform its field staff about products that appear to be in violation of FDA's laws and regulations and thus may be detained without physical examination. We may subject future shipments of fish or fishery products to DWPE when there is information that causes future shipments of a product or products to appear violative within the meaning of section 801(a) of the FD&amp;C Act. Such information may exist based on the violative history of a product, manufacturer, shipper, grower, importer, geographic area, or country.</P>
                <P>
                    To carry out the provisions of section 801(a) of the FD&amp;C Act when we detain 
                    <PRTPAGE P="9854"/>
                    an article that appears violative, we provide notice to the owner or consignee of the nature of the violation and the right to present testimony regarding the admissibility of the article (21 CFR 1.94). Frequently, owners or consignees submit analytical test results based on samples taken from the article subject to DWPE as evidence demonstrating admissibility. We then determine if the testimony (analytical package, information, or other evidence) is sufficient. If the evidence is adequate to overcome the appearance of the violation(s), FDA will allow the article to proceed for entry into the United States. If the evidence is not adequate to remove the appearance of the violation(s), the entry will be refused admission into the United States.
                </P>
                <P>In addition, interested parties may request that their products be removed from DWPE. FDA decisions to remove a product, manufacturer, or other entity from DWPE are based on evidence establishing that the conditions that gave rise to the appearance of a violation have been resolved and we have confidence that future shipments of the product to the United States will be in compliance with the FD&amp;C Act. FDA may consider analytical results from successful consecutive tests as part of the evidence to support removal from DWPE.</P>
                <P>The draft guidance, when finalized, will provide recommendations for collecting a representative sample for products subject to DWPE under an import alert due to the appearance of adulteration caused by pathogens, unlawful animal drugs, scombrotoxin (histamine), and/or decomposition. When finalized, the draft guidance will also help foreign manufacturers and other processors of fish and fishery products subject to DWPE introduce evidence to FDA to support a request to have products removed from DWPE.</P>
                <P>The recommendations in the draft guidance include sample sizes based on a critical nonconformities sampling strategy. Using this statistical sampling equation, the amount of sampling recommended can be structured commensurate with the level of concern, and risk to consumers, associated with the type of adulteration to be addressed. For more information, see “Derivation of Sampling Recommendations Related to Recommendations for Collecting Representative Samples for Food Testing Used as Evidence for Release of Certain Fish and Fishery Products Subject to Detention Without Physical Examination (DWPE) and Removal of a Foreign Manufacturer's Goods from DWPE; Guidance for Industry” (Ref. 1). As the draft guidance makes clear, persons may propose alternative sampling plans and explain the basis for such alternatives.</P>
                <P>
                    We note that the draft guidance refers to the final rule entitled “Laboratory Accreditation for Analyses of Foods” (LAAF Rule, which is codified at 21 CFR part 1, subpart R). FDA is taking a stepwise approach to implementing the LAAF Rule based, in part, on reaching sufficient LAAF-accredited laboratory capacity for food testing (see 86 FR 68728 at 68739 and 68740, December 3, 2021). FDA may publish one or more documents in the 
                    <E T="04">Federal Register</E>
                     giving owners and consignees 6 months' notice before requiring them to use a LAAF-accredited laboratory for food testing covered by the rule (id.). We will monitor LAAF Rule implementation and update any final guidance based on this draft guidance accordingly.

                <HD SOURCE="HD1">I. Background</HD>
                <P>In July 2012, Congress passed the Generic Drug User Fee Amendments of 2012 (GDUFA I) (Pub. L. 112–144). GDUFA I was designed to enhance public access to safe, high-quality generic drugs and to modernize the generic drug program. To support this goal, FDA agreed in the Generic Drug User Fee Act Program Performance Goals and Procedures (GDUFA I commitment letter) to work with industry and interested stakeholders on identifying science and research initiatives specific to generic drugs for each fiscal year covered by GDUFA I.</P>
                <P>
                    In August 2017, GDUFA was reauthorized until September 2022 through the Generic Drug User Fee Amendments of 2017 (GDUFA II) (Pub. L. 115–52), and in September 2022, GDUFA was reauthorized until September 2027 through the Generic Drug User Fee Amendments of 2022 (GDUFA III) (Pub. L. 117–180, 136 Stat. 2155). In the GDUFA Reauthorization

                <P>The purpose of this public workshop is to obtain input from industry and other interested stakeholders on identifying generic drug science and research initiatives for FY 2025. FDA is interested in receiving input about regulatory science initiatives for the ongoing years of the GDUFA III science and research program, and particularly for FY 2025.</P>
                <P>Topics discussed during the workshop will focus on research that is needed to address scientific knowledge gaps and associated challenges impacting the development and regulatory assessment of generic products, including complex generics. As examples, topics discussed will likely relate to nitrosamine drug substance-related impurities, drug-device combination products, predictive tools to improve the efficiency of generic product development, and other topics that can enhance public access to high quality, safe and effective generic products. Specific presentations and discussions at this workshop will be announced at a later date and may differ from the topics above. Input about the topics above will help the Agency identify and expand its scientific focus for the next fiscal year.</P>
                <P>
                    FDA will consider all comments made at this workshop or received through the docket (see

                     This information collection consists of 39 online survey questions that will be sent to 207 covered entities and business associates that participated in the 2016–2017 OCR HIPAA Audits. The survey will gather information relating to the effect of the audits on the audited entities and the entities' opinions about the audit process.
                </P>
                <P>
                    OCR is conducting a review of the 2016–2017 HIPAA Audits to determine its efficacy in assessing the HIPAA compliance efforts of covered entities. 
                    <PRTPAGE P="9858"/>
                    As part of that review, the online survey will be used to:
                </P>
                <P>Measure the effect of the 2016–2017 HIPAA Audits on covered entities' and business associates' subsequent actions to comply with the HIPAA Rules.</P>
                <P>Provide entities with an opportunity to give feedback on the Audit and its features, such as the helpfulness of HHS' guidance materials and communications, the utility of the online submission portal, whether the Audit helped improve entity compliance, and the entities' responses to the Audit-report findings and recommendations.</P>
                <P>Provide OCR with information on the burden imposed on entities to collect audit-related documents and to respond to audit-related requests; and</P>
                <P>Seek feedback on the effect of the HIPAA Audit program on the entities' day-to-day business operations.</P>
                <P>The information, opinions, and comments collected using the online survey will be used to improve future OCR HIPAA Audits.</P>

                <P>
                    On December 2, 2022, U.S. Customs and Border Protection (CBP) published a General Notice (the December 2 Notice) in the 
                    <E T="04">Federal Register</E>
                     (87 FR 74157) announcing a National Customs Automation Program (NCAP) Test concerning the submission through the Automated Commercial Environment (ACE) of certain unique entity identifiers for the Global Business Identifier (GBI) Evaluative Proof of Concept (EPoC). On July 21, 2023, CBP published a General Notice (the July 21 Notice) in the 
                    <E T="04">Federal Register</E>
                     (88 FR 47154) extending and modifying the December 2 Notice. Specifically, the July 21 Notice extended the test period from July 21, 2023, through February 14, 2024; provided the correct web address for interested parties to use to obtain the Legal Entity Identifier (LEI) from the Global Legal Entity Identifier Foundation (GLEIF); and clarified that CBP would allow participants to provide one or more of the three identifiers for the manufacturers, shippers, and sellers (and optionally, exporters, distributors, and packagers) of merchandise, and that CBP would not require transmission of all three identifiers to participate in the test. This document republishes and supersedes the July 21 Notice, with the following modifications.
                </P>
                <P>First, the test period has been extended from February 14, 2024, through February 23, 2027. Second, CBP made changes to Sections I.B. (Global Business Identifier Evaluative Proof of Concept (GBI EPoC)) and VI. (Evaluation Criteria) to clarify the purpose and scope of the test. CBP will continue to assess the functionality and effectiveness of universal global business identifiers to address data gaps caused by the unreliability of the manufacturer or shipper identification code (MID), in addition to exploring opportunities to enhance supply chain traceability and visibility more broadly—including examining how CBP, Partner Government Agencies (PGAs), and the trade industry might leverage GBIs to comply with growing supply chain traceability requirements.</P>
                <P>Third, CBP has expanded the GBI EPoC to include entries of merchandise classifiable in any subheading of the Harmonized Tariff Schedule of the United States (HTSUS) and entries of imported merchandise from any country of origin. When CBP initially launched the GBI EPoC, the test was limited to entries of merchandise in five (5) categories (alcohol, toys, seafood, personal items, and medical devices), and to merchandise with 10 countries of origin (Australia, Canada, China, France, Italy, Mexico, New Zealand, Singapore, United Kingdom, and Vietnam). These requirements significantly limited the range of entries that could be evaluated under the test. As a result, CBP is removing these test limitations. It is important to note that the test continues to be limited to type 01 (formal) and type 11 (informal) entries.</P>
                <P>
                    Fourth, as noted in the 
                    <E T="02">FOR FURTHER INFORMATION CONTACT</E>
                     section above, the office responsible for the GBI EPoC has changed (it is no longer the Interagency Collaboration Division, Trade Policy and Programs Directorate, Office of Trade, but is now the Trade Modernization Division, Trade Policy and Programs Directorate, Office of Trade), and the point of contact for interested parties without an assigned client representative who have technical questions has changed. Fifth, GS1 and Dun &amp; Bradstreet have created specific web pages dedicated to the GBI EPoC for obtaining a GBI; Section III.A. (Obtaining Global Business Identifier (GBI) Numbers) has been updated to include the new web addresses for the 
                    <PRTPAGE P="9860"/>
                    dedicated GBI web pages. Lastly, CBP has made minor technical changes to Sections V. (Paperwork Reduction Act) and VI. (Evaluation Criteria).  
                </P>
                <P>For ease of reference, the July 21 Notice is republished below, with the changes described above.</P>
                <HD SOURCE="HD1">I. Background</HD>
                <HD SOURCE="HD2">A. The National Customs Automation Program</HD>
                <P>The National Customs Automation Program (NCAP) was established by Subtitle B of Title VI—Customs Modernization, in the North American Free Trade Agreement Implementation Act (Customs Modernization Act) (Pub. L. 103–182, 107 Stat. 2057, 2170, December 8, 1993) (19 U.S.C. 1411). Through the NCAP, the thrust of customs modernization was focused on informed trade compliance and the development of the Automated Commercial Environment (ACE), the planned successor to the Automated Commercial System (ACS). ACE is an automated and electronic system for commercial trade processing, intended to streamline business processes, facilitate growth in trade, ensure cargo security, and foster participation in global commerce, while facilitating compliance with U.S. laws and regulations and reducing costs for U.S. Customs and Border Protection (CBP) and all of its communities of interest. The ability to meet these objectives depends on successfully modernizing CBP's business functions and the information technology that supports those functions. CBP's modernization efforts are accomplished through phased releases of ACE component functionality, which update the system and add new functionality.</P>
                <P>Sections 411 through 414 of the Tariff Act of 1930 (19 U.S.C. 1411–1414), as amended, define and list the existing and planned components of the NCAP (Section 411), promulgate program goals (Section 412), provide for the implementation and evaluation of the program (Section 413), and provide for Remote Location Filing (Section 414). Section 411(a)(1)(A) lists the electronic entry of merchandise, Section 411(a)(1)(B) lists the electronic entry summary of required information, and Section 411(a)(1)(D) lists the electronic transmission of manifest information, as existing NCAP components. Section 411(d)(2)(A) provides for the periodic review of data elements collected in order to update the standard set of data elements, as necessary.</P>
                <HD SOURCE="HD2">B. Global Business Identifier Evaluative Proof of Concept (GBI EPoC)</HD>
                <P>ACE is the system through which the U.S. Government has implemented the “Single Window,” the primary system for processing trade-related import and export data required by the PGAs that work alongside CBP in regulating specific commodities. The transition away from paper-based procedures has resulted in faster, more streamlined processes for both the U.S. Government and industry. To continue this progress, CBP began working with the Border Interagency Executive Council (BIEC) and the Commercial Customs Operations Advisory Committee (COAC), starting in 2017, to discuss the continuing viability of the data element known as MID.</P>
                <P>
                    Currently, importers of record provide the MID at the time of filing of the entry summary. 
                    <E T="03">See generally</E>
                     19 CFR part 142. The 13-digit MID is derived from the name and address of the manufacturer or shipper, as specified on the commercial invoice, by applying a code constructed pursuant to instructions specified by CBP. 
                    <E T="03">See</E>
                     Customs Directive No. 3550–055, dated November 24, 1986 (available online at 
                    <E T="03">https://www.cbp.gov/sites/default/files/documents/3550-055_3.pdf</E>
                    ). Although use of the MID has served CBP and the international trade community well in the past, it has become apparent that the MID is not always a consistent or unique number. For example, the MID is based upon the manufacturer or shipper name, address, and country of origin, and this data can change over time and/or result in the same MID for multiple entities. Also, while the MID provides limited identifying information, other global unique identifiers capture a broader swath of pertinent information regarding the entities with which they are associated (
                    <E T="03">e.g.,</E>
                     legal ownership of businesses, specific business and global locations, and supply chain roles and functions). Changes in international trade and technology for tracking the flow of commodities have presented an opportunity for CBP and PGAs to explore new processes and procedures for identifying the parties involved in the supply chains of imported goods.
                </P>
                <P>CBP has thus engaged in regular outreach with stakeholders, including, but not limited to, importers of record, licensed customs brokers, trade associations, and PGAs, with a goal of obtaining meaningful feedback on their existing systems and operations in order to establish a mutually beneficial global entity identifier system. As a result of these discussions, CBP developed the Global Business Identifier Evaluative Proof of Concept (GBI EPoC), which is an interagency trade transformation project that aims to test global business identifiers as a supply chain traceability solution, for industry and the U.S. Government alike. The GBI EPoC seeks to amplify the U.S. Government's visibility into the supply chain of goods entering the U.S. and explore opportunities for CBP and PGAs to leverage verifiable information regarding parties in the supply chain to improve risk assessment and admissibility decisions.</P>
                <P>For purposes of the GBI EPoC, ACE has been modified to permit test participants to provide the following entity identifiers (GBIs) associated with manufacturers, shippers, and sellers of merchandise covered by entries that meet the GBI EPoC criteria: nine (9)-digit Data Universal Numbering System (D–U–N–S®), thirteen (13)-digit Global Location Number (GLN), and/or twenty (20)-digit Legal Entity Identifier (LEI). The GBIs will be provided in addition to other required entry data (which may include the MID); any GBIs associated with the importer of record itself need not be provided as part of this test. The GBIs associated with the manufacturers, shippers and sellers will be provided with the CBP Form 3461 (Entry/Immediate Delivery) data transmission via the Automated Broker Interface (ABI) in ACE for formal entries for consumption (“entry type 01” in ACE) and informal entries (“entry type 11” in ACE). CBP will then access the underlying data (GBI data) associated with the D–U–N–S®, GLN, and LEI, as set forth in the agreements that CBP has entered into with Dun &amp; Bradstreet (D&amp;B), GS1, and the Global Legal Entity Identifier Foundation (GLEIF), respectively, in order to connect a specific entry and merchandise to a more complete picture of those entities' ownership, structure, and affiliations, among other information. D&amp;B, GS1, and GLEIF are collectively referred to as the identity management companies (IMCs).</P>
                <P>
                    Through the GBI EPoC, CBP aims to leverage existing entity identifiers—the D–U–N–S®, GLN, and LEI—to develop a systematic, accurate, and efficient method for the trade to report, and the U.S. Government to uniquely identify, legal business entities, their different business locations and addresses, and their various functions and supply chain roles. CBP will consider whether these three GBIs, singly, or in concert, ensure that CBP and PGAs receive standardized trade data in a universally compatible trade language. Moreover, CBP will examine whether the GBIs 
                    <PRTPAGE P="9861"/>
                    submitted to CBP can be easily verified, thus reducing uncertainties that may be associated with the information related to shipments of imported merchandise. CBP will also consider whether the GBI EPoC may ultimately prove to be a more far-reaching, interagency initiative, one that keeps with the vision and actualized promise of the “Single Window,” by providing better visibility into the supply chain for CBP and PGAs, thereby further reducing paper processing, expediting cargo release, and enhancing the traceability of supply chains.
                </P>
                <HD SOURCE="HD1">II. Authorization for the Test</HD>
                <P>
                    The Customs Modernization Act authorizes the Commissioner of CBP to conduct limited test programs or procedures designed to evaluate planned components of the NCAP. The GBI EPoC is authorized pursuant to 19 CFR 101.9(b), which provides for the testing of NCAP programs or procedures.

                <HD SOURCE="HD1">III. Conditions for the Test</HD>
                <P>The test is voluntary, and importers of record and licensed customs brokers who wish to participate in the test must comply with all of the conditions set forth below. The full effect of access to additional entity-related data based on submission of the GBIs will be a key evaluation metric of the test.</P>
                <P>Participation in the test will provide test participants with the opportunity to test and give feedback to CBP on the GBI EPoC design and scope. Participation may also enable test participants to establish and test their digital fingerprints, such as more accurately identifying certain parties involved in their supply chains. In addition, participation may allow the trade community to better manage and validate their data and streamline their import data collection processes. Lastly, test participation may allow for the wider application of entity identifiers that are currently providing broad sector coverage and enhanced data analysis.</P>
                <HD SOURCE="HD2">A. Obtaining Global Business Identifier (GBI) Numbers  </HD>
                <P>Importers of record and licensed customs brokers who are interested in participating in the test must arrange to obtain any combination of the required D–U–N–S®, GLN, and/or LEI entity identifiers (the GBIs) from the manufacturers, shippers, and sellers of merchandise that are intended to be covered by future entries that will meet the conditions of the test (commodity + country of origin). For purposes of providing the information required for the test, the parties are defined as follows for each covered entry:</P>
                <P>• Manufacturer (or supplier)—The party that last manufactures, assembles, produces, or grows the goods or the party supplying the finished goods in the country from which the goods are leaving for the United States.</P>
                <P>• Shipper—The party that enters into a contract for carriage with, and arranges for delivery of the goods to, a carrier or transport intermediary for transportation to the United States.</P>
                <P>• Seller—The last known party by whom the goods are sold or agreed to be sold. If the goods are to be imported otherwise than in pursuance of a purchase, the owner of the goods must be provided.</P>
                <P>Optionally, test participants may also arrange to obtain the GBIs for exporters, distributors, and packagers that will be associated with these future entries and provide them to CBP on qualifying entries covered by this test.</P>
                <P>
                    A party may obtain its own GBI by contacting Dun and Bradstreet (D&amp;B) at

                    ) with the subject heading “Request to Participate in the GBI EPoC.” As part of their request to participate, importers of record and licensed customs brokers must agree to provide available GBIs with entry filings for merchandise that is subject to the conditions of the test and state that they intend to participate in the test. The request must include the potential participant's filer code and evidence that it has obtained at least one of the three identifiers (D–U–N–S®, GLN, and LEI), or is in the process of obtaining an identifier, from the manufacturers, shippers, and sellers (and, optionally, exporters, distributors, and packagers) of merchandise to be entered pursuant to the test.
                </P>
                <P>Test participants who are importers of record and do not self-file must advise CBP in their request that they have authorized their licensed customs broker(s) to file qualifying entries under the test on their behalf. Test participants who are licensed customs brokers must advise CBP that they have been authorized to file qualifying entries on behalf of importers of record whose shipments meet the test criteria as set forth below.</P>
                <P>CBP began accepting requests to participate in the test on December 2, 2022, and will continue to accept them until the test concludes. Anyone providing incomplete information, or otherwise not meeting the test requirements, will be notified by email, and given the opportunity to resubmit the request to participate in the test.</P>

                <P>
                    As part of the test, CBP has entered into agreements with D&amp;B, GS1, and GLEIF (the IMCs) for limited access to the underlying data (GBI data) that is associated with the GBIs for the duration of the test and for testing of CBP's automated systems.

                    <FTREF/>
                     The data elements for which CBP has entered into agreements with D&amp;B, GS1, and GLEIF may include, but are not limited to: (1) entity identifier numbers, (2) official business titles; (3) names; (4) addresses; (5) financial data; (6) trade names; (7) payment history; (8) economic status; and (9) executive names. The data elements will be examined as part of the test.

                    <P>
                        <SU>1</SU>
                         As noted above, D&amp;B, GS1, and GLEIF are IMCs. The GBI data consists of data provided by the relevant entity to the IMCs in order to generate a GBI—the D–U–N–S®, GLN, or LEI. GBIs allow CBP to link the underlying GBI data to specific entities and entries.
                    </P>
                </FTNT>
                <P>Consistent with the agreements, CBP may access GBI data, combine it with CBP data, and evaluate the GBIs that the test participants provide with an entry filing. The GBI data will assist CBP and PGAs in determining the optimal combination of the three entity identifiers (the GBIs) that will provide the U.S. Government with sufficient entity data needed to support identification, monitoring, and enforcement procedures to better equip the U.S. Government to focus on high-risk shipments and bad actors.</P>
                <P>CBP will process entries submitted pursuant to the test by analyzing the GBIs submitted via ABI in ACE and ensuring that the GBIs are submitted correctly. CBP will then evaluate the submitted entries to assess the ease and cost of obtaining each of the GBIs, evaluating each GBI to ensure that it is being submitted properly per the technical requirements that will be set forth in CBP and Trade Automated Interface Requirements (CATAIR), and ensuring that CBP is able to validate that each GBI is accurate using the underlying GBI data from the IMCs or otherwise known to CBP.</P>
                <HD SOURCE="HD2">G. Partner Government Agencies (PGAs)</HD>
                <P>
                    PGAs are important to the success of the test. Certain PGAs, which may receive GBIs and GBI data and are intended as core test beneficiaries, may use the GBIs and GBI data to improve risk management and import compliance. This may result in smarter, more efficient, and more effective compliance efforts. CBP will announce the PGAs who will receive GBIs and GBI data pursuant to the test in a notice to be published in the

                <P>Misconduct under the test may include, but is not limited to, submitting false GBIs with an entry filing. Currently, CBP does not plan to assess penalties against GBI EPoC participants that fail to timely and accurately submit GBIs during the test. CBP also does not anticipate shipment delays due to the failure to file or the erroneous filing of GBIs. However, test participants are expected to follow all other applicable regulations and requirements associated with the entry process.</P>
                <P>After an initial six-month period (or at such earlier time as CBP deems appropriate), a test participant may be subject to discontinuance from participation in this test for any of the following repeated actions:</P>
                <P>• Failure to follow the terms and conditions of this test;</P>
                <P>• Failure to exercise due diligence in the execution of participant obligations;</P>

                    If the Director, Trade Modernization Division (TMOD), Trade Policy and Programs (TPP), Office of Trade (OT), finds that there is a basis to discontinue a participant's participation in the test, then CBP will provide written notice, via email, proposing the discontinuance with a description of the facts or conduct supporting the proposal. The test participant will be offered the opportunity to respond to the Director's proposal in writing within 10 business days of the date of the written notice. The response must be forwarded to the TMOD Director, TPP, OT, by emailing 
                    <E T="03">GBI@cbp.dhs.gov,</E>

                <P>
                    The Director, TMOD, will issue a final decision in writing on the proposed action within 30 business days after receiving a timely-filed response from the test participant, unless such time is extended for good cause. If no timely response is received, the proposed notice becomes the final decision of CBP as of the date that the response period expires. A proposed discontinuance of a test participant's privileges will not take effect unless the response process under this paragraph has been concluded with a written decision that is adverse to the test participant, which will be provided via email.

                <P>The Paperwork Reduction Act (PRA) of 1995 (44 U.S.C. 3507(d)) requires that CBP consider the impact of paperwork and other information collection burdens imposed on the public. An agency may not conduct, and a person is not required to respond to, a collection of information unless the collection of information displays a valid control number assigned by the Office of Management and Budget (OMB).</P>
                <P>The collection of GBI information gathered under this test has been approved by OMB in accordance with the requirements of the PRA under OMB control number 1651–0141. In addition, the Entry/Immediate Delivery Application and ACE Cargo Release (CBP Form 3461 and 3461 ALT) collection of information, which collects the GBI when entry is made, has been approved by OMB under OMB control number 1651–0024.</P>
                <HD SOURCE="HD1">VI. Evaluation Criteria</HD>
                <P>The test is intended to evaluate the feasibility of utilizing GBIs to address data gaps caused by the unreliability of the MID, in addition to exploring opportunities to enhance supply chain traceability and visibility more broadly—including examining how CBP, PGAs, and the trade industry might leverage GBIs to comply with growing supply chain traceability requirements. This will involve exploring the use of GBIs to accurately identify legal business entities, their different business locations and addresses, as well as their various functions and supply chain roles, based upon information derived from the unique D–U–N–S®, GLN, and LEI entity identifiers. The test will assist CBP in enforcing applicable laws and protecting the revenue, while fulfilling trade modernization efforts by assisting the agency in verifying the roles, functions and responsibilities that various entities play in a given participant's importation of merchandise. CBP's evaluation of the test, including the review of any comments submitted to CBP during the duration of the test, will be ongoing with a view to possible extension or expansion of the test.</P>
                <P>
                    CBP will evaluate whether the test: (1) improves foreign entity data for trade facilitation, enforcement, risk management, and statistical integrity; (2) ensures U.S. Government access to foreign entity data; (3) institutionalizes a global, managed identification system; (4) implements a cost-effective solution; (5) obtains stakeholder buy-in; and (6) facilitates legal compliance across the U.S. Government. At the conclusion of the test, an evaluation will be conducted to assess the efficacy of the information received throughout the course of the test. The final results of the evaluation will be published in the 
                    <E T="04">Federal Register</E>
                     as required by section 101.9(b)(2) of the CBP regulations (19 CFR 101.9(b)(2)).
                </P>
                <P>Should the GBI EPoC be successful and ultimately be codified under the CBP regulations, CBP anticipates that this data would greatly enhance ongoing trade entity identification and resolution, reduce risk, and improve compliance operations. CBP would also anticipate greater supply chain visibility and additional information with which to verify and validate information on legal entities, which will support better decision-making during customs clearance processes.</P>

                <SUBJECT>Notice of Lodging of Proposed Consent Decree Under the Clean Water Act</SUBJECT>
                <P>
                    On February 5, 2024, the Department of Justice lodged a proposed consent decree with the United States District Court for the District of Massachusetts in 
                    <E T="03">United States and Commonwealth of Massachusetts</E>
                     v. 
                    <E T="03">City of Lowell, Massachusetts,</E>
                     1:24–cv–10290 (D. Mass.).
                </P>
                <P>
                    The United States filed a complaint for injunctive relief and civil penalties under sections 309(b) and (d) of the Clean Water Act, 33 U.S.C. 1319(b) and (d), against Defendant, City of Lowell for: (1) unpermitted and illegal discharges from its wastewater collection system, without authorization under a National Pollutant Discharge Elimination System (“NPDES”) permit and in violation of section 301 of the Clean Water Act, 33 U.S.C. 1311; and (2) unpermitted and illegal discharges of pollutants from its Small Municipal Separate Storm Sewer System. The Commonwealth of Massachusetts has moved to file an Intervenor's Complaint alleging violations of the Clean Water Act, the Massachusetts Clean Waters Act, M.G.L. c. 21, sections 26–53, and the regulations promulgated thereunder, 314 C.M.R. sections 3.00, 
                    <E T="03">et seq.,</E>
                     7.00, 
                    <E T="03">et seq.,</E>
                     and 12.00, 
                    <E T="03">et seq.</E>
                     Under the proposed Consent Decree among the parties, the City of Lowell must take measures necessary to achieve and maintain compliance with the Federal Clean Water Act, the Massachusetts Clean Waters Act, and the City's NPDES permit. These include measures to separate wastewater sewer pipes and stormwater pipes to prevent sewage discharges to the Merrimack and Concord Rivers and Beaver Brook from the combined pipes during rain events. Under the proposed Consent Decree, the City will also update and implement its Illicit Discharge Detection and Elimination program to detect and eliminate illicit connections from wastewater pipes or other sources of wastewater to the stormwater system. Finally, under the proposed settlement, the City will pay a $200,000 civil penalty for past noncompliance.

                     The SSV collects annual administrative data on allegations and substantiated incidents of sexual victimization from adult correctional and juvenile justice authorities. To meet the requirements of the Prison Rape Elimination Act of 2003 (PREA; Pub. L. 108–79), the survey will be administered to the Federal Bureau of Prisons and all state prison systems, all state juvenile justice systems, all facilities operated by the U.S. Military and U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement, all privately operated jails, and all juvenile facilities in Indian country. Representative samples of adult public jails, adult jails in Indian country, adult private prisons, and local and private juvenile justice facilities will also be included. These data are used to provide insight into the total number of allegations being reported to correctional authorities, the outcomes of investigations of allegations, and the characteristics of incidents, victims and perpetrators. Revisions to the collection include revised sampling designs, updated definitions of sexual victimization, and modifications to the survey forms to collect more information about victims and perpetrators of sexual victimization and to make survey forms more user-friendly.

                    OSHA does not mandate that employers establish fire brigades; however, if they do so, they must comply with certain provisions of the Standard. The Standard imposes the following paperwork requirements on each employer who establishes a fire brigade: Write an organizational statement; ascertain the fitness of workers with specific medical conditions to participate in fire related operations; and provide appropriate training and information to fire brigade members. For additional substantive information about this ICR, see the related notice published in the 
                    <E T="04">Federal Register</E>
                     on November 22, 2023 (88 FR 81435).

                <P>
                    This information collection is subject to the PRA. A Federal agency generally cannot conduct or sponsor a collection of information, and the public is generally not required to respond to an information collection, unless the OMB approves it and displays a currently valid OMB Control Number. In addition, notwithstanding any other provisions of law, no person shall generally be subject to penalty for failing to comply with a collection of information that does not display a valid OMB Control Number.

                        The Department of Labor, as part of its continuing effort to reduce paperwork and respondent burden, conducts a pre-clearance request for comment to provide the general public and Federal agencies with an opportunity to comment on proposed

                        collections of information in accordance with the Paperwork Reduction Act of 1995. This request helps to ensure that: requested data can be provided in the desired format; reporting burden (time and financial resources) is minimized; collection instruments are clearly understood; and the impact of collection requirements on respondents can be properly assessed. Currently, the OWCP/DEEOIC is soliciting comments on the information collection for DEEOIC Authorization Forms, EE–22, EE–24, EE–26, EE–28, EE–30, EE–32.

                <P>
                    The Office of Workers' Compensation Programs (OWCP) is the primary agency responsible for administration of the Energy Employees Occupational Illness Compensation Program Act of 2000, as amended (EEOICPA), 42 U.S.C. 7384 
                    <E T="03">et seq.</E>
                     EEOICPA provides for the payment of compensation to covered employees and, where applicable, survivors of deceased employees, who sustained either an “occupational illness” or a “covered illness” in the performance of duty for the Department of Energy and certain of its contractors and subcontractors. One element of the compensation provided to covered employees is medical benefits for the treatment of their occupational or covered illnesses that are accepted as compensable. OWCP contracts with a private sector bill processing agent that handles many of the tasks associated with paying bills for medical treatment provided to covered employees under EEOICPA. This bill processing agent uses an automated system that matches incoming bills with the authorized medical treatment of covered employees before it issues payments, and a provider of medical treatment, supplies or services to covered employees must provide the bill processing agent with information necessary for creation of an authorization within the agent's automated system before a bill can be paid. The collection of this information is authorized by 20 CFR 30.400(a) and (c), 30.403, 30.404(b) and 30.700. The information collections in this ICR collect demographic, factual and medical information that OWCP and/or its bill processing agent needs to process bills for medical treatment, supplies or services.

                <P>
                    The Office of Workers' Compensation Programs (OWCP) administers the Federal Employees' Compensation Act (FECA), 5 U.S.C. 8101 
                    <E T="03">et seq.,</E>
                     the Black Lung Benefits Act (BLBA), 30 U.S.C. 901 
                    <E T="03">et seq.,</E>
                     and the Energy Employees Occupational Illness Compensation Program Act of 2000 (EEOICPA), 42 U.S.C. 7384 
                    <E T="03">et seq.</E>
                     All three statutes require OWCP to pay for covered medical treatment that is provided to beneficiaries, and to reimburse beneficiaries for any out-of-pocket covered medical expenses they have paid. Form OWCP–915, Claim for Medical Reimbursement, is used for this purpose and collects the necessary beneficiary and medical provider data in a standard format. Beneficiaries must also attach billing information prepared by the medical provider (Form OWCP–1500 for professional medical services, Form OWCP–04 for institutional providers and hospitals, or a paper bill for medications dispensed in the physician's office. The hour and cost burdens to collect the billing information from medical providers in the required attachments to Form OWCP–915 are accounted for in OMB Nos. 1240–0019, 1240–0044, and 1240–0050. This is the same billing information a medical provider reports when it bills OWCP directly. Regulations implementing the FECA, BLBA and EEOICPA programs require the collection of information that is needed to determine if reimbursement claims submitted by beneficiaries can be paid.

                     Agreement States will be asked to provide a list of sites undergoing decommissioning, and a point of contact for information about uranium recovery and complex sites undergoing decommissioning that are regulated by the Agreement States. The information request will allow the NRC to compile, in a centralized location, a list of sites and points of contact who can provide information regarding Agreement State sites undergoing decommissioning in the United States. This does not apply to information, such as trade secrets and commercial or financial information provided by the Agreement States, that is considered privileged or confidential.

                <P>(iv) Market-wide NBB and NBO spread and size requirements, which require 300 shares at both the NBB and NBO during at least 50% of Regular Trading Hours for both Qualified Securities and Enhanced Securities. For Qualified Securities, the NBBO spread of such shares must be no wider than 2% for a security priced equal to or greater than $5 and no wider than 7% for a security priced less than $5. For Enhanced Securities, the NBBO spread of such shares must be no wider than 1% for securities priced equal to or greater than $5 and no wider than 2% for securities priced less than $5; and</P>
                <P>(v) Depth of book requirements, which, for securities priced equal to or greater than $5 requires at least $150,000 of displayed posted liquidity on both the buy and the sell side within the percentages described below during at least 90% of Regular Trading Hours and, for securities priced less than $5, at least $50,000 of displayed posted liquidity on both the buy and the sell side within the percentages described below during at least 90% of Regular Trading Hours. For Qualified Securities, such liquidity must be within 2% of both the NBB and NBO for securities priced equal to or greater than $5 and within 7% of both the NBB and NBO for securities priced less than $5. For Enhanced Securities, such liquidity must be within 1% of both the NBB and NBO for securities priced equal to or greater than $5 and within 2% of both the NBB and NBO for securities priced less than $5.</P>
                <P>Now, the Exchange proposes to adopt similar Minimum Performance Standards applicable to Primary Equity Securities under proposed Rule 11.8(e)(1)(E)(i) and move the existing Minimum Performance Standards, which would be applicable only to Closed-End Funds, to proposed Rule 11.8(e)(1)(E)(ii). Specifically, the Minimum Performance Standards applicable to Primary Equity Securities would be set forth in Rule 11.8(e)(1)(E)(i)(a)–(e), as discussed below.</P>
                <P>Proposed subparagraph (a) would require that the LMM is registered as a market maker in good standing with the Exchange and is identical to the existing requirement under Rule 11.8(e)(1)(E)(i).</P>
                <P>Proposed subparagraph (b) would set forth the time at the inside requirements identical to existing Rule 11.8(e)(1)(E)(ii), except for the percentage of time the LMM must have quotes at the NBB and NBO. Specifically, subparagraph (b) would provide that the time at the inside requirements, which, for Qualified Securities, require that an LMM maintain quotes at the NBB and the NBO at least 10% of Regular Trading Hours where the security has a consolidated average daily volume equal to or greater than 500,000 shares and at least 20% of Regular Trading Hours where the security has a consolidated average daily volume of less than 500,000 shares. For Enhanced Securities, an LMM must quote at the NBB and the NBO at least 10% of Regular Trading Hours where the security has a consolidated average daily volume equal to or greater than 500,000 shares and at least 20% of Regular Trading Hours where the security has a consolidated average daily volume of less than 500,000 shares. Under the current structure, LMMs in Corporate Securities and Closed-End Funds that meet the Enhanced Security Minimum Performance Standards are eligible to receive higher incentives than such LMMs that meet the Qualified Security Minimum Performance Standards because such Enhanced Security Minimum Performance Standards are more stringent. As proposed, the Qualified Security Minimum Performance Standards and Enhanced Security Minimum Performance Standards for Corporate Securities are identical, as are the proposed incentives which are discussed in further detail below. Nonetheless, the Exchange is proposing to keep the concept of Qualified Security Minimum Performance Standards and Enhanced Security Minimum Performance Standards in the Exchange's Rulebook as the Exchange expects to modify those Minimum Performance Standards (at a later date through another proposal) so that they are not identical.</P>
                <P>Proposed subparagraph (c) would set forth the auction participation requirements identical to existing Rule 11.8(e)(1)(E)(iii), except for the percentage requirements as it relates to Enhanced Securities for both the Opening and Closing Auction. Specifically, subparagraph (c) would require that for a Qualified Security, the Opening Auction price is within 4% of the last Reference Price, as defined in Rule 11.23(a)(19), and 4% for an Enhanced Security. For a Qualified Security, such requirements provide that the Closing Auction price must be within 3% of the last Reference Price and 3% for an Enhanced Security. As described above, while the Exchange acknowledges that the proposed quoting requirements for Qualified Security Minimum Performance Standards and Enhanced Security Minimum Performance Standards are identical, the Exchange expects to modify these requirements at a later date through another proposal.</P>
                <P>Proposed subparagraph (d) would set forth the market-wide NBB and NBO spread and size requirements identical to existing Rule 11.8(e)(1)(E)(iv), except that the requirements would not consider the price of the security, and that the applicable percentage requirements for both Qualified and Enhanced Securities could be different. Specifically, proposed Rule 11.8(e)(1)(E)(i)(d) would require 300 shares at both the NBB and NBO during at least 50% of Regular Trading Hours for both Qualified Securities and Enhanced Securities. For Qualified Securities, the NBBO spread of such shares must be no wider than 5%. For Enhanced Securities, the NBBO spread of such shares must be no wider than 5%. As described above, while the Exchange acknowledges that the proposed spread requirements for Qualified Security Minimum Performance Standards and Enhanced Security Minimum Performance Standards are identical, the Exchange expects to modify these requirements at a later date through another proposal.</P>
                <P>
                    Proposed subparagraph (e) would set forth the depth of book requirements identical to existing Rule 11.8(e)(1)(E)(v), except that the requirements would not consider the price of the security, and the applicable percentage requirements for both Qualified and Enhanced Securities could be different. Specifically, proposed Rule 11.8(e)(1)(E)(i)(E) would require at least $50,000 of displayed posted liquidity on both the buy and the sell side within the percentages described below during at least 90% of Regular Trading Hours. For Qualified Securities, such liquidity must be within 5% of both the NBB and NBO. For Enhanced Securities, such liquidity must be within 5% of both the NBB and NBO. As described above, while the Exchange acknowledges that the proposed depth of book requirements 
                    <PRTPAGE P="9877"/>
                    for Qualified Security Minimum Performance Standards and Enhanced Security Minimum Performance Standards are identical, the Exchange expects to modify these requirements at a later date through another rule filing.
                </P>
                <P>As noted above, to conform the proposal to the Exchange's rulebook, the Exchange proposes to move the existing Minimum Performance Standards for Closed-End Funds to proposed Rule 11.8(e)(1)(E)(ii)(a)–(e). The Exchange is not proposing to modify any of the Minimum Price Standards applicable to Closed-End Funds at this time.</P>
                <P>The Exchange also proposes to modify the Exchange's Fee Schedule to delineate the LMM program applicable to Primary Equity Securities from the LMM program applicable to ETPs and Closed-End Funds, as provided in footnote 14 of the Fee Schedule, and to adopt and amend definitions included in the Fee Schedule to clarify the difference in the LMM programs. The Exchange notes that it is not proposing any substantive change to the LMM Pricing under footnote 14 of the Fee Schedule as it relates to ETPs and Closed-End Funds, but is merely extricating Corporate Securities from existing LMM Pricing and establishing new applicable pricing to LMMs in Corporate Securities.</P>
                <P>
                    First, the Exchange proposes to modify the current definition of Qualified LMM to apply only to Corporate Securities. Currently, the definition of Qualified LMM applies to all BZX-listed securities, including Corporate Securities, ETPs, and Closed-End Funds. Now, the Exchange proposes to modify the definition of Qualified LMM to provide that it meets the Minimum Performance Standards defined in proposed Rule 11.8(e)(1)(E)(i), which are applicable to Corporate Securities. The Exchange also proposes to adopt a new definition for “Qualified ETP LMM”, which would mean an LMM in a BZX-listed ETP or Closed-End Fund security that meets Qualified ETP LMM performance standards set forth in Rule 11.8(e)(1)(E).
                    <SU>12</SU>
                    <FTREF/>
                     Such Minimum Performance Standards for Closed-End Funds are defined in Rule 11.8(e)(1)(E)(ii). The Exchange is not proposing any substantive change to the term Qualified LMM as it pertains to ETPs or Closed-End Funds, but is simply proposing a new definition in order to clearly delineate Qualified LMMs in Corporate Securities from Qualified LMMs in ETPs and Closed-End Funds. Finally, while not new in concept, the Exchange proposes to adopt a new definition for “LMM Securities”, which would mean BZX-listed securities for which a Member is an LMM. Currently, the term “LMM Security” is defined in footnote 14(A)(i) of the Fee Schedule, but, as described below, the Exchange is proposing to modify the existing definition so that it applies only to ETPs and Closed-End Funds. As the term “LMM Security” is used as a defined term elsewhere in the Fee Schedule, the Exchange is proposing to adopt a new definition under the “Definitions” section of the Fee Schedule that is substantively identical to the existing term in footnote 14(A)(i).

                         Such standards applicable to ETPs and Closed-End Funds will vary between LMM Securities depending on the price, liquidity, and volatility of the LMM Security in which the LMM is registered. The performance measurements will include: (A) percent of time at the NBBO; (B) percent of executions better than the NBBO; (C) average displayed size; and (D) average quoted spread. For additional detail, see LMM Program Filing.

                </FTNT>
                <P>As noted above, footnote 14 of the Fee Schedule sets forth LMM Pricing on the Exchange. The Exchange proposes to re-letter existing paragraphs (A) through (D) under footnote 14, to (B) through (E), respectively, to provide for new paragraph (A). Proposed paragraph (A) would set forth the Liquidity Provision Rates applicable to Primary Equity Securities (also referred to as “Corporate Securities”) listed on the Exchange. Specifically, paragraph (A) would provide that Qualified LMMs in BZX-listed Primary Equity Securities are eligible to receive the Corporate LMM Add Liquidity Rebate for such Corporate Securities for a calendar month on a security-by-security basis. For each calendar month the Qualified LMM will receive a rebate of $0.0030 per share (or the greater of any other applicable rebate). Qualified LMMs in Corporate Securities will be subject to the standard remove fee of $0.0030 per share in securities priced at or above $1.00, and 0.30% of the total dollar value for securities priced below $1.00.</P>
                <P>Currently, LMMs in Corporate Securities are eligible to receive the LMM Liquidity Provision Rates as provided under paragraph (A) of footnote 14 in the Fee Schedule, which provides for a maximum stipend for LMMs that meet the Minimum Performance Standards. As proposed, LMMs in Corporate Securities will no longer be eligible for the LMM Liquidity Provision Rates program but may have the potential to receive higher incentives under the proposed program as the rebates are transaction-based and therefore have no maximum incentive in a given month.</P>
                <P>Similarly, because the Exchange has proposed to modify the Minimum Performance Standards applicable to Corporate Securities, the Exchange is also proposing that LMMs in Corporate Securities will no longer be eligible for the LMM Add Liquidity Rebate as provided under paragraph (B) of footnote 14 in the Fee Schedule. As proposed, the LMM Add Liquidity Rebates would continue to be available to LMMs in ETPs and Closed-End Funds. The LMM Add Liquidity Rebate currently provides that LMMs in BZX-listed securities that have a consolidated average daily volume (“CADV”) greater than or equal to 1,000,000 (an “ALR Security”) are eligible to receive the LMM Add Liquidity Rebate for such ALR Securities for a calendar month on a security-by-security basis. For each calendar month in which an LMM is a Qualified LMM in an ALR Security, the LMM will receive the greater of an enhanced rebate of $0.0039 per share (instead of any other applicable rebate for transactions in the ALR Security) or the LMM Liquidity Provision Rates described above that would otherwise apply for the LMM in the applicable ALR Security. While the proposed Corporate LMM Liquidity Provision Rates provide a lower rebate than the current LMM Add Liquidity Rebate, the Exchange believes that the proposed rebate is commensurate with the difficulty of meeting the proposed Minimum Performance Standards and transacting volume in Corporate Securities.</P>
                <P>
                    The Exchange proposes to modify the naming conventions in proposed paragraph (B) under footnote 14 to make clear that the Liquidity Provision Rates are only applicable to ETPs and Closed-End Funds, and are not applicable to Corporate Securities. Specifically, proposed paragraph (B)(i) under footnote 14 would provide that LMMs in BZX-listed ETP and Closed-End Fund securities (“ETP LMMs”) will receive the applicable rates on a daily basis per security for which the LMM is a Qualified ETP LMM (a “Qualified ETP Security”) based on the average aggregate daily auction volume of the BZX-listed securities for which the Member is the ETP LMM (“ETP LMM Securities”). Proposed paragraph (B)(ii) under footnote 14 would provide that LMMs in BZX-listed ETP and Closed-End Fund securities will receive the applicable rates on a daily basis per Qualified ETP Security for which they also meet certain enhanced market quality standards (an “Enhanced ETP Security”) in addition to the Standard Rates provided in paragraph (B)(i) under footnote 14. The Exchange also proposes to modify the description of the rates to 
                    <PRTPAGE P="9878"/>
                    provide that the daily incentive is applicable to a Qualified ETP Security or Enhanced ETP Security, as applicable. The Exchange is not proposing any changes to the calculation of the ETP and Closed-End Fund LMM Liquidity Provision Rates.
                </P>
                <P>The Exchange proposes to modify proposed paragraph (C) under footnote 14 to provide that the LMM Add Liquidity Rebate is only applicable to ETP and Closed-End Fund securities listed on the Exchange. Accordingly, proposed paragraph (C) would state that ETP LMMs, as defined in paragraph (B)(i) of footnote 14, in BZX-listed securities that have a CADV ≥1,000,000 (an “ALR Security”) are eligible to receive the ETP LMM Add Liquidity Rebate for such ALR Securities for a calendar month on a security-by-security basis. For each calendar month in which an ETP LMM is a Qualified ETP LMM in an ALR Security, the ETP LMM will receive the greater of an enhanced rebate of $0.0039 per share (instead of any other applicable rebate for transactions in the ALR Security) or the ETP LMM Liquidity Provision Rates described above that would otherwise apply for the ETP LMM in the applicable ALR Security. ETP LMMs in an ALR Security remain eligible to achieve other incentives and tiers unless otherwise explicitly excluded. The Exchange is not proposing to change how the LMM Add Liquidity Rebate is calculated or the amount of the rebate, but is merely modifying it to extricate Corporate Securities from the rebate program.</P>
                <P>The Exchange is proposing no changes to proposed paragraph (D) under footnote 14. Closing Auction rates applicable to LMMs in ETP, Closed-End Funds and Corporate BZX-Listed securities will continue to transact for free in the Closing Auction in their LMM Securities.</P>

                    The Exchange believes the proposed rule change is consistent with the Act and the rules and regulations thereunder applicable to the Exchange and, in particular, the requirements of Section 6(b) of the Act.

                     Specifically, the Exchange believes the proposed rule change is consistent with the Section 6(b)(5)

                    <FTREF/>
                     requirements that the rules of an exchange be designed to prevent fraudulent and manipulative acts and practices, to promote just and equitable principles of trade, to foster cooperation and coordination with persons engaged in regulating, clearing, settling, processing information with respect to, and facilitating transactions in securities, to remove impediments to and perfect the mechanism of a free and open market and a national market system, and, in general, to protect investors and the public interest. Further, the Exchange believes that the proposed rule change is consistent with Section 6(b)(4),
                    <SU>15</SU>
                    <FTREF/>
                     in that it provides for the equitable allocation of reasonable dues, fees and other charges among members and other persons using any facility or system which the Exchange operates or controls and it does not unfairly discriminate between customers, issuers, brokers or dealers. The Exchange also notes that its listing business operates in a highly-competitive market in which market participants, which includes both issuers of securities and LMMs, can readily transfer their listings or opt not to participate, respectively, if they deem fee levels, liquidity provision incentive programs, or any other factor at a particular venue to be insufficient or excessive. The LMM Program reflects a competitive pricing structure designed to incentivize issuers to list new products and transfer existing products to the Exchange and market participants to enroll and participate as LMMs on the Exchange, which the Exchange believes will enhance market quality in all ETPs, Primary Equity Securities, and Closed-End Funds listed on the Exchange.

                <P>The Exchange believes that the proposal to adopt separate Minimum Performance Standards applicable to Primary Equity Securities is consistent with the Act because it will enhance market quality in those securities. Under the current LMM Program, LMMs in Corporate Securities are incentivized to provide tightened spreads, deeper liquidity, and provide better execution opportunities. As proposed, LMMs in Corporate Securities will continue to be incentivized to meet Minimum Performance Standards, albeit with slightly less stringent standards than are currently applicable. Nonetheless, the Exchange believes the proposed Minimum Performance Standards are appropriate for Corporate Securities, which are typically more liquid than other types of listed products. Further, the Exchange believes Minimum Performance Standards tailored specifically to Corporate Securities listed on the Exchange will be more attractive to LMMs as they more closely align with quoting and trading activity in those securities, while still generally aligning with the existing Minimum Performance Standards on the Exchange, which LMMs are already familiar with.</P>
                <P>The Exchange believes that the proposed rebate under the Proposed Corporate LMM Liquidity Provision Rates is reasonable as they are in-line with other rebates available to Members on the Exchange. For example, under the Add Volume Tiers of footnote 1 of the Fee Schedule, Members are eligible for rebates ranging from $0.0020 up to $0.0031 per share if they meet certain required criteria. Furthermore, as discussed above, LMMs will continue to be eligible for other rebates, such as those available under the Add Volume Tiers, and will receive the greater among the rebates that it qualifies.</P>
                <P>The Exchange believes it is reasonable to separate Corporate Securities from ETP and Closed-End Fund securities in the LMM Program. In particular, as the Exchange is proposing to adopt specific liquidity rates applicable to LMMs in Corporate Securities, the Exchange believes it follows to remove Corporate Securities from the existing liquidity provisions of proposed sections (B) and (C) under footnote 14 of the Fee Schedule.</P>
                <P>
                    The Exchange also believes that it is reasonable to provide incentives to LMMs in Corporate Securities on a transaction basis rather than solely achieving certain objective market quality metrics. Unlike ETPs, Corporate Securities are valued on the trading price of the security rather than derived from the underlying assets owned by the ETP.
                    <SU>16</SU>
                    <FTREF/>
                     Therefore, the Exchange believes it is important to incentivize both transactions and market quality metrics in those securities. The Exchange believes its proposed LMM Program for Corporate Securities strikes an appropriate balance by requiring an LMM to achieve certain Minimum Performance Standards in order to be eligible to receive the Corporate LMM Liquidity Provision Rates on the 
                    <PRTPAGE P="9879"/>
                    Exchange, as provided in proposed footnote 14(A) of the Fee Schedule.

                         The end-of-day net asset value (“NAV”) of an ETP is a daily calculation based off of the most recent closing prices of the underlying assets and an accounting of the ETP's total cash position at the time of calculation. ETPs are generally subject to a creation and redemption mechanism to ensure that the ETP's price does not fluctuate too far from the NAV, which mechanisms mitigate the potential for exchange trading to impact the price of an ETP. The “arbitrage function” performed by market participants influences the supply and demand of shares, and thus, trading prices relative to NAV. The arbitrage function helps to keep an ETP's price in line with the value of its underlying portfolio, and the Exchange believes that the arbitrage mechanism is generally an effective and efficient means of ensuring that intraday pricing in ETPs closely tracks the value of the underlying portfolio or reference assets.

                    As described above, the Exchange proposes to provide fees and rebates specifically applicable to a Qualified LMM in transactions in BZX-listed Primary Equity Securities as provided in proposed footnote 14(A). The Exchange believes that the proposed fee for liquidity removing transactions in Corporate Securities is reasonable as it is generally consistent with the standard liquidity removing fee on the Exchange which charges a fee of $0.0030 per share for securities priced above $1. The Exchange also believes the proposed rebate for liquidity adding transactions in Corporate Securities is reasonable as it appropriately incentivizes LMMs to meet the proposed Minimum Performance Standards throughout the month in addition to transacting in those Corporate Securities. The Exchange notes that the proposed rebate is generally in-line with other volume adding incentives (
                    <E T="03">e.g.,</E>
                     the add volume tiers under footnote 1 of the Fee Schedule offer rebates ranging from $0.0020 up to $0.0031 per share), and the Exchange believes such rebate is reasonably commensurate with the Minimum Performance Standards and transaction requirements of the proposed Corporate LMM Liquidity Provision Rates.

                <HD SOURCE="HD2">B. Self-Regulatory Organization's Statement on Burden on Competition</HD>
                <P>The Exchange does not believe that the proposed rule changes will impose any burden on competition not necessary or appropriate in furtherance of the purposes of the Act. The Exchange does not believe the proposed change burdens competition, but rather, enhances competition as it is intended to increase the competitiveness of BZX both among Members by incentivizing Members to become LMMs in BZX-listed Primary Equity Securities and as a listing venue by enhancing market quality in those securities. The marketplace for listings is extremely competitive and there are several other national securities exchanges that offer listings. Transfers between listing venues occur frequently for numerous reasons, including market quality. This proposal is intended to help the Exchange compete as a listing venue. Accordingly, the Exchange does not believe that the proposed changes will impair the ability of issuers, LMMs, or competing listing venues to maintain their competitive standing. The Exchange also notes that the proposed change is intended to enhance market quality in BZX-listed Primary Equity Securities, to the benefit of all investors in such BZX-listed securities. The Exchange does not believe the proposed amendment would burden intramarket competition as it would be available to all Members uniformly. Registration as an LMM is available equally to all Members and allocation of listed securities between LMMs is governed by Exchange Rule 11.8(e)(2). Further, if an LMM does not meet the applicable Minimum Performance Standards for three out of the past four months, the LMM would continue to be subject to forfeiture of LMM status for that LMM Security, at the Exchange's discretion.</P>

                     the Commission may designate a shorter time of such action is consistent with the protection of investor and the public interest. The Exchange has asked the Commission to waive the 30-day operative delay so that the proposed rule change may become operative upon filing. The Exchange states that waiving the operative delay would allow market participants to realize immediately the benefits of the proposal, which the Exchange states include market quality enhancements, and would help the Exchange better compete as a listing venue for Primary Equity Securities without undue delay. The proposed change raises no novel legal or regulatory issues. Based on the foregoing, the Commission believes that waiving the 30-day operative delay is consistent with the protection of investors and the public interest. Therefore, the Commission hereby waives the operative delay and designates the proposal operative upon filing.

                    <SU>14</SU>
                    <FTREF/>
                     to determine whether the proposed rule change should be approved or disapproved. Institution of proceedings is appropriate at this time in view of the legal and policy issues raised by the proposed rule change, as discussed below. Institution of proceedings does not indicate that the Commission has reached any conclusions with respect to any of the issues involved. Rather, as described below, the Commission seeks and encourages interested persons to provide comments on the proposed rule change.

                     the Commission is providing notice of the grounds for disapproval under consideration. The Commission is instituting proceedings to allow for additional analysis of the proposed rule change's consistency with Section 6(b)(5) of the Act, which requires, among other things, that the rules of a national securities exchange be “designed to prevent fraudulent and manipulative acts and practices” and “to protect investors and the public interest.”

                <P>The Commission asks that commenters address the sufficiency of the Exchange's statements in support of the proposal, which are set forth in the Notice, in addition to any other comments they may wish to submit about the proposed rule change. In particular, the Commission seeks comment on the following questions and asks commenters to submit data where appropriate to support their views:  </P>
                <P>
                    1. Given the nature of the underlying assets held by the Trust, has the Exchange properly filed its proposal to list and trade the Shares under BZX Rule 14.11(e)(4), Commodity-Based Trust Shares? 
                    <SU>17</SU>
                    <FTREF/>

                    <P>
                        <SU>17</SU>
                         BZX Rule 14.11(e)(4)(C)(i) defines the term “Commodity-Based Trust Shares” as a security (a) that is issued by a trust that holds (1) a specified commodity deposited with the trust, or (2) a specified commodity and, in addition to such 
                        <PRTPAGE/>
                        specified commodity, cash; (b) that is issued by such trust in a specified aggregate minimum number in return for a deposit of a quantity of the underlying commodity and/or cash; and (c) that, when aggregated in the same specified minimum number, may be redeemed at a holder's request by such trust which will deliver to the redeeming holder the quantity of the underlying commodity and/or cash.
                    </P>

                <P>2. The Exchange raises substantially similar arguments to support the listing and trading of the Shares as those made in proposals to list and trade spot bitcoin exchange-traded products (“Bitcoin ETPs”). Do commenters agree that arguments to support the listing of Bitcoin ETPs apply equally to the Shares? Are there particular features related to ether and its ecosystem, including its proof of stake consensus mechanism and concentration of control or influence by a few individuals or entities, that raise unique concerns about ether's susceptibility to fraud and manipulation?</P>
                <P>3. What are commenters' views on whether the proposed Trust and Shares would be susceptible to manipulation? What are commenters' views generally on whether the Exchange's proposal is designed to prevent fraudulent and manipulative acts and practices? What are commenters' views generally with respect to the liquidity and transparency of the ether markets and the ether markets' susceptibility to manipulation?</P>
                <P>

                     do commenters agree with the Exchange that the Chicago Mercantile Exchange (“CME”), on which CME ether futures trade, represents a regulated market of significant size related to spot ether?

                    <FTREF/>
                     What are commenters' views on whether there is a reasonable likelihood that a person attempting to manipulate the Shares would also have to trade on the CME to manipulate the Shares?

                    5. The Exchange states that ether is resistant to price manipulation and that other means to prevent fraudulent and manipulative acts and practices “exist to justify dispensing with the requisite surveillance sharing agreement” with a regulated market of significant size related to spot ether.
                    <SU>22</SU>
                    <FTREF/>
                     In support, the Exchange states, among other things, that the geographically diverse and continuous nature of ether trading make it difficult and prohibitively costly to manipulate the price of ether, and that the fragmentation across ether platforms, the relatively slow speed of transactions, and the capital necessary to maintain a significant presence on each trading platform make manipulation of ether prices through continuous trading activity challenging.

                    6. The Exchange also states that it will execute a surveillance-sharing agreement with Coinbase, Inc. (“Coinbase”) that is intended to supplement the Exchange's market surveillance program.
                    <SU>24</SU>
                    <FTREF/>
                     According to the Exchange, the agreement is “expected to have the hallmarks of a surveillance-sharing agreement between two members of the [Intermarket Surveillance Group], which would give the Exchange supplemental access to data regarding spot [ether] trades on Coinbase where the Exchange determines it is necessary as part of its surveillance program for the Commodity-Based Trust Shares.” 
                    <SU>25</SU>
                    <FTREF/>
                     Based on the description of the surveillance-sharing agreement as provided by the Exchange, what are commenters' views of such an agreement if finalized and executed? Do commenters agree with the Exchange that such an agreement with Coinbase would be “helpful in detecting, investigating, and deterring fraud and market manipulation in the Commodity-Based Trust Shares”?

                    7. The Exchange states that the “Sponsor's research indicates daily correlation between the spot [ether] and the CME [ether] [f]utures is 0.998.”

                    <FTREF/>
                     The Exchange further states that this “high correlation” indicates that there is a reasonable likelihood that a person attempting to manipulate the Trust would also have to trade on the CME ether futures market.
                    <SU>28</SU>
                    <FTREF/>
                     What are commenters' views on the correlation between the ether spot market and the CME ether futures market? What are commenters' views on the extent to which a surveillance-sharing agreement with the CME would assist in detecting and deterring fraud and manipulation that impacts an exchange-traded product (“ETP”) that holds spot ether, and on whether the Sponsor's daily price correlation analysis provides any evidence to this effect? What are commenters' views generally on whether an ETP that holds CME ether futures and an ETP that holds spot ether are similar products?

                </P>
                <P>Securities Act Rule 236 (17 CFR 230.236) provides an exemption from registration under the Securities Act for the offering of shares of stock or similar securities to provide funds to be distributed to security holders in lieu of fractional shares, scrip certificates or order forms, in connection with a stock dividend, stock split, reverse stock split, conversion, merger or similar transaction. Issuers wishing to rely upon the exemption are required to furnish specified information to the Commission at least 10 days prior to the offering. The information is needed to provide notice that the issuer is relying on the exemption. Approximately 10 respondents file the information required by Rule 236 at an estimated 1.5 hours per response for a total annual reporting burden of 15 hours (1.5 hours per response × 10 responses).</P>
                <P>Written comments are invited on: (a) whether this proposed collection of information is necessary for the proper performance of the functions of the agency, including whether the information will have practical utility; (b) the accuracy of the agency's estimate of the burden imposed by the collection of information; (c) ways to enhance the quality, utility, and clarity of the information collected; and (d) ways to minimize the burden of the collection of information on respondents, including through the use of automated collection techniques or other forms of information technology. Consideration will be given to comments and suggestions submitted in writing within 60 days of this publication by April 12, 2024.</P>

                <P>
                    Since 2016, FINRA has undertaken a series of initiatives in consultation with the U.S. Department of the Treasury (“Treasury Department”) to increase transaction reporting and transparency in the market for U.S. Treasury Securities.

                     On July 10, 2017, FINRA members began reporting information on transactions in U.S. Treasury Securities to TRACE.

                <HD SOURCE="HD2">Dissemination of Transaction-Level Information</HD>
                <P>
                    Under the proposed rule change, FINRA would begin disseminating individual transaction information for On-the-Run Nominal Coupon U.S. Treasury Securities on an end-of-day basis. The disseminated transaction information would be anonymized, 
                    <E T="03">i.e.,</E>
                     it would not include the market participant identifier (“MPID”) or other information that could be used to identify parties to the trade. However, consistent with other TRACE products, the disseminated transaction information would include counterparty type (
                    <E T="03">i.e.,</E>
                     dealer, customer, affiliate, or alternative trading system (“ATS”)), a flag to indicate whether the trade was executed on an ATS, and other trade modifiers and indicators.
                </P>
                <P>
                    To implement such dissemination, FINRA proposed to amend Rule 6750(c)(5) (to be redesignated as Rule 6750(d)(5)) to provide that FINRA would not disseminate information on a transaction in a TRACE-Eligible Security that is a U.S. Treasury Security “other than an On-the-Run Nominal Coupon.” FINRA also proposed to add a new paragraph (c) to Rule 6750 providing that FINRA would disseminate information on individual transactions in On-the-Run Nominal Coupons on an end-of-day basis.
                    <SU>14</SU>
                    <FTREF/>
                     To further clarify the scope of transactions subject to individual dissemination under amended Rule 6750, FINRA proposed to add as new paragraph (ll) of Rule 6710 (Definitions) a definition of “On-the-Run Nominal Coupon,” defined as the most recently auctioned U.S. Treasury Security that is a Treasury note or bond paying fixed rate nominal coupons starting after the close of the TRACE system on the day of its Auction through the close of the TRACE system on the day of the Auction of a new issue for the next U.S. Treasury Security of the same maturity. The definition would specify that On-the-Run Nominal Coupons do not include Treasury bills, STRIPS, Treasury Inflation-Protected Securities, floating rate notes, or any U.S. Treasury Security that is a Treasury note or bond paying a fixed rate nominal coupon that is not the most recently issued U.S. Treasury Security of a given maturity (
                    <E T="03">i.e.,</E>
                     off-the-run nominal coupons).

                        <SU>14</SU>
                         To accommodate the addition of new paragraph 6750(c), the proposed rule change would redesignate current Rule 6750(c) as Rule 6750(d). The proposed rule change would also make conforming changes to the paragraph cross-references in Rule 6750(a) and Supplementary Material .01 to Rule 6750.

                        <SU>15</SU>
                         FINRA will identify the most recently auctioned U.S. Treasury Security that is a Treasury note or bond paying fixed rate nominal coupons as an “On-the-Run Nominal Coupon” in TRACE reference data beginning on the business day after its auction.

                <HD SOURCE="HD2">Dissemination Protocols</HD>
                <P>
                    To mitigate concerns about information leakage for large trades, FINRA proposed to implement transaction size caps above which the exact size of the transaction would not be disseminated. In consultation with the Treasury Department, FINRA proposed to apply the following transaction size dissemination caps based on the maturity of the On-the-Run Nominal Coupon at issuance: 
                    <SU>16</SU>
                    <FTREF/>

                        <SU>16</SU>
                         FINRA would incorporate information about these dissemination caps in the TRACE dissemination protocols published on its website, available at 
                        <E T="03">https://www.finra.org/filing-reporting/trade-reporting-and-compliance-engine-trace/trace-reporting-timeframes.</E>
                         Specifically, information about the dissemination caps would be added as a new bullet in the “Transparency” column of the row of the table describing the protocols for “Treasury Bonds,” to read as follows: “Individual transactions in On-the-Run Nominal Coupons are disseminated on an end-of-day basis with security identifiers (
                        <E T="03">e.g.,</E>
                         CUSIP) and the following transaction size caps based on the maturity of the security at issuance: 2 Years: $250 million; 3 Years: $250 million; 5 Years: $250 million; 7 Years: $150 million; 10 Years: $150 million; 20 Years: $50 million; 30 Years: $50 million.”
                    </P>
                </FTNT>
                <P>• Two Years: $250 million;</P>
                <P>• Three Years: $250 million;</P>
                <P>• Five Years: $250 million;</P>
                <P>• Seven Years: $150 million;</P>
                <P>• 10 Years: $150 million;</P>
                <P>• 20 Years: $50 million; and</P>
                <P>• 30 Years: $50 million.</P>
                <P>
                    Thus, for example, a $200 million transaction in a 10-year On-the-Run Nominal Coupon would be disseminated with a trade size of “150MM+” rather than the actual dollar amount of the trade.
                    <SU>17</SU>
                    <FTREF/>
                     In consultation with the Treasury Department and based on ongoing analysis of the data, FINRA may in the future adjust the dissemination caps to maintain an appropriate balance between the benefits of transparency and the threat of information leakage. Any proposed changes to the dissemination caps would be filed with the Commission pursuant to Section 19(b)(1) of the Act.

                         As described further below, these dissemination caps would apply for the end-of-day dissemination file. Consistent with its approach to other TRACE data products, FINRA also plans to provide a Historic TRACE data product covering the same scope of transactions, which would provide the actual, uncapped transaction sizes on a six-month delay.

                    <FTREF/>
                     to include data products providing information on individual transactions in On-the-Run Nominal Coupons. Generally, Historic TRACE Data includes the same information as provided in the End-of-Day TRACE Transaction File, except that the Historic TRACE Data does not include dissemination caps for large transactions. Historic Treasury Data would also be subject to a minimum six-month delay, as is the case for the existing Historic Corporate Bond and Historic Agency Data sets.
                    <SU>20</SU>
                    <FTREF/>
                     FINRA proposed that the End-of-Day TRACE Transaction File and Historic Data include a new set of data for U.S. Treasury Securities with the same fees that exist for other sets of TRACE-Eligible Securities.

                         The End-of-Day TRACE Transaction File includes all Real-Time TRACE transaction data collected from that day. The File is separately available for each data set for which Real-Time TRACE transaction data is available (
                        <E T="03">i.e.,</E>
                         the Corporate Bond Data Set, Agency Data Set, Securitized Product (“SP”) Data Set, and Rule 144A Data Set) and made public after the TRACE system closes each day.

                        <SU>19</SU>
                         The Historic TRACE Data is also made separately available for each data set after a fixed delay period that varies by asset type. Historic Corporate Bond and Historic Agency Data are delayed a minimum of six months; Historic SP Data is delayed a minimum of 18 months; and Historic Rule 144A Data carries a delay consistent with the delay period applicable to the component security type (
                        <E T="03">e.g.,</E>
                         the delay for a Rule 144A transaction in a SP is 18 months, while the delay for a Rule 144A transaction in a corporate bond is six months).

                    Specifically, FINRA explains that it considered the notional cap sizes suggested by primary dealers' feedback to the Treasury Department and translated these values to DV01.
                    <SU>47</SU>
                    <FTREF/>
                     When translated to DV01, the median suggested transaction caps ranged between $70,000 and $190,000.
                    <SU>48</SU>
                    <FTREF/>
                     FINRA, in consultation with the Treasury Department, opted to consider as a baseline caps that approximately equated to $100,000 DV01, though it also considered the percentage of traded market volume that would be disseminated (versus reported) across each maturity and the estimated amount of time it would take to liquidate a position at the size of the cap. In addition, FINRA states that the 
                    <PRTPAGE P="9886"/>
                    proposed caps were calibrated to the maturity, liquidity, and trading concentration of the underlying security to preserve the anonymity of market participants trading large transactions.

                    <FTREF/>
                     FINRA explains that it ultimately sought to balance the benefits of providing similar levels of transparency across maturities with the risk that dissemination of the largest transactions could permit market participants to reverse engineer the identities, positions, and trading strategies of others.

                    In approving the original TRACE rules, the Commission stated that price transparency plays a fundamental role in promoting fairness and efficiency of U.S. capital markets.

                     To further the goal of increasing price transparency in the debt markets in general and the U.S. Treasury Securities market in particular, it is reasonable and consistent with the Act for FINRA to extend post-trade price transparency to transactions in U.S. Treasury Securities in the manner set forth in the proposal. Since 2017, FINRA has collected post-trade transaction information for U.S. Treasury Securities through TRACE.

                     In 2020, FINRA commenced public dissemination of aggregate data on U.S. Treasury Securities trading volume on a weekly basis.
                    <SU>55</SU>
                    <FTREF/>
                     In 2023, FINRA shortened the publication time of aggregate data on U.S. Treasury Securities from a weekly to a daily basis and increased the information publicly disseminated to include, among other things, pricing information for certain U.S. Treasury Securities.
                    <SU>56</SU>
                    <FTREF/>
                     FINRA's current proposal will further increase price transparency by making individual transaction data available with an end-of-day dissemination and with appropriate cap sizes and on a historical basis for U.S. Treasury Securities that are On-the-Run Nominal Coupons.

                    The proposal is reasonably designed to preserve the confidentiality of individual market participants and transactions. While commenters described concerns that transaction-level transparency could cause information leakage, discouraging transactions and impairing market liquidity, the proposal is reasonably designed to mitigate these concerns by incorporating transaction size dissemination caps, delaying dissemination until the end of each day, and limiting the scope to On-the-Run Nominal Coupons. This scope limitation is a reasonable first step, instead of including every security in the U.S. Treasury Security market, or specifically transactions in first, second, and third old off-the-run U.S. Treasury Securities, as some commenters suggested.

                     FINRA has affirmed that any changes in the level of transparency it provides, including changes to the dissemination cap sizes or scope of transactions included, would be based on careful analysis and filed with the Commission as proposed rule changes pursuant to Section 19(b)(1) of the Act.

                    <SU>60</SU>
                    <FTREF/>
                     The proposal strikes an appropriate balance between fulfilling the goal of increased transparency and mitigating risks that could impair liquidity in the market for U.S. Treasury Securities. While some commenters suggested using a notional amount calculation method for the dissemination caps,

                    <FTREF/>
                     the proposal makes a reasonable choice of method of calculating dissemination caps by calibrating them to the maturity, liquidity, and trading concentration of the underlying securities to preserve the anonymity of market participants trading large transactions.

                    Lastly, the proposed dissemination fees are consistent with the Act. The TRACE U.S. Treasury Security end-of-day and historic data sets are comparable, in terms of granularity and timeliness, to existing data sets for other TRACE-eligible securities. Thus, charging the same fee level for TRACE end-of-day and historic data products that include U.S. Treasury Securities data as is currently charged for TRACE end-of-day and historic data products that include data about securities other than U.S. Treasury Securities, while maintaining the current fee levels for those data products, is reasonable. Section 15A(b)(5) of the Act requires, among other things, that FINRA rules provide for the equitable allocation of reasonable dues, fees, and other charges among members and issuers and other persons using any facility or system which the association operates or controls. The rules that establish the current TRACE end-of-day and historic data products have been approved by the Commission, and the fees that FINRA proposes to charge for information on individual transactions in U.S. Treasury Securities are identical to those that currently apply for end-of-day and historic data products for other types of TRACE-eligible securities,

                    <E T="03">1. Representative Availability Portal for Social Security Administration Hearings—20 CFR 404.929, 404.933, 404.1740, 416.1429, 416.1433, 416.1540, 418.1350, 422.203—0960–NEW.</E>
                     As part of the appeals process, claimants can request a hearing with an Administrative Law Judge (ALJ). Approximately 80 percent of claimants have appointed representatives at the hearing level. When the Social Security Administration (SSA) schedules hearings before an ALJ, it usually considers the availability of appointed representatives, if applicable. Appointed representatives may be members of large firms, appearing at hearings nationwide, or may be solo practitioners servicing a specific geographic location or hearing office. In both situations, it is typical for appointed representatives to represent more than one claimant at any given moment; some represent hundreds of claimants at once. 
                </P>
                <P>Historically, the process of seeking, tracking, and considering representative availability has been a manual and time-intensive activity. In the past, hearing offices sought representative availability information by contacting each representative individually. More recently, Office of Hearings Operations' Regional Offices representatives collected availability information. Representatives provided Regional Office staff with their hearing availability via telephone or email. However, the process for gathering and considering representative availability was not standardized and varied greatly amongst Regional Offices. The appointed representative community informed SSA they would appreciate a consistent and standardized electronic process to submit their availability for hearing appearances.</P>
                <P>
                    In the Spring of 2023, SSA initiated the Enhanced Representative Availability Process (ERAP) to provide representatives with a more standardized and streamlined process to email their availability for hearings. In the interim, SSA obtained OMB approval to test a new Representative Availability Portal (Portal) to offer the representative community a web-based option to submit their monthly availability to SSA, as per 
                    <E T="03">20 CFR 404.1740(b)(3)(iii)</E>
                     and 
                    <E T="03">416.1540(b)(3)(iii)</E>
                     and in a manner consistent with ERAP. SSA tested the portal among 11 appointed representative practice groups nationwide. We are currently seeking OMB approval for the national rollout of the Portal, which collects standardized information regarding appointed representative availability for the purpose of scheduling hearings.
                </P>
                <P>
                    SSA plans to roll the Portal out to all appointed representatives registered with the Registration, Appointment and Services for Representatives (RASR) application, other professional representatives who regularly conduct hearing business with SSA but are not registered with RASR, and delegated officials from appointed representative's Designated Scheduling Groups (DSG). A DSG is a representative-identified scheduling group which can include one representative, or multiple representatives. Respondents will need to have a 
                    <E T="03">mySocial Security</E>
                     account to use the Portal and be registered into the Portal by SSA systems. Respondents who wish to use the Portal, but who are not registered with RASR, or who do not have a Representative ID, must provide SSA systems with the necessary data, including name and SSN, to complete the Portal registration process.
                </P>
                <P>
                    Portal respondents, once registered, are authorized representatives and delegated officials from appointed representatives' DSG. SSA will use the Portal to track availability for hearings for the DSG. Representatives provide hearing availability for the DSG monthly (as described above), and SSA considers the DSG-provided availability when scheduling hearings. SSA will announce the response window for the Portal each month via a reminder email, approximately ten days prior to the deadline for Portal submissions. Following the submission deadline, the Portal will “lock,” and respondents will not be able to submit availability through the Portal at that time. However, SSA has some discretion to approve a request for a late submission 
                    <PRTPAGE P="9888"/>
                    or modification and plans to have the capacity to unlock the Portal, when warranted. Portal response options will include DSG group, hearing region, availability during the period of submission, and respondent-preferred case maximums. The Portal will allow SSA to obtain the information we require to schedule hearings for attendees.
                </P>
                <P>If the respondents choose not to submit their availability via the Portal, the option of submitting their availability through email submission (as is the current practice) will remain. If a representative elects not to timely submit any availability via the Portal or email, SSA will schedule their hearings without their input.</P>
                <P>We expect use of the Portal will result in receiving consistent structured data from appointed representatives, which will allow for a more streamlined and effective hearing scheduling process. The Portal also meets a longstanding customer-experience request by the representative community, one of SSA's key stakeholders in the process.</P>
                <P>The respondents are appointed representatives, and delegated officials from appointed representatives' DSGs who need to submit their availability to SSA for hearings.</P>

                     The death of a beneficiary is an event that terminates the individual's entitlement to Social Security benefits. As regulated, states must furnish death information to SSA to compare to SSA's payment files. SSA employs two modalities for ensuring it efficiently receives accurate information regarding the deaths of SSA-insured workers and beneficiaries: (1) Form SSA–721, Statement of Death by Funeral Director; and (2) the Electronic Death Registration (EDR). SSA operates the State Death Match collections, which includes the EDR process for electronically reporting death records to SSA. The states furnish death certificate information to SSA via a manual registration process (the SSA–721), or via the Electronic Death Registration Process (EDR). Both death match processes are automated electronic transfers between the states and SSA. This collection, via paper form SSA–721 or the EDR, allows for the funeral director or funeral home responsible for the individual's burial or cremation to report the death to SSA. SSA uses this information for three purposes: (1) to establish proof of death for the insured worker; (2) to determine if the insured individual was receiving any pre-death benefits SSA needs to terminate; and (3) to ascertain which surviving family member is eligible for the lump-sum death payment or for other death benefits. The respondents for this information collection are funeral directors who handled death arrangements for the insured individuals, and the states' bureaus of vital statistics.

                    <E T="03">3. Retaining Employment and Talent After Injury/Illness Network (RETAIN)—0960–0821.</E>
                     The SSA and the U.S. Department of Labor (DOL) are conducting the Retaining Employment and Talent After Injury/Illness Network (RETAIN) demonstration. The RETAIN demonstration tests the impact of early intervention strategies that improve stay-at-work/return-to-work (SAW/RTW) outcomes of individuals who experience work disability while employed. We define “Work disability” as an injury, illness, or medical condition that has the potential to inhibit or prevent continued employment or labor force participation. SAW/RTW programs succeed by returning injured or ill workers to productive work as soon as medically possible during their recovery process, and by providing interim part-time or light duty work and accommodations, as necessary. We loosely modeled the RETAIN Demonstration Projects after promising programs operating in Washington State, including the Centers of Occupational Health and Education (COHE), the Early Return to Work (ERTW), and the Stay at Work programs. While these programs operate within the state's workers' compensation system, and are available only to people experiencing work-related injuries or illnesses, the RETAIN Demonstration Projects provide opportunities to improve SAW/RTW outcomes for both occupational and non-occupational injuries and illnesses of people who are employed, or at a minimum in the labor force, when their injury or illness occurs.
                </P>
                <P>The primary goals of the RETAIN Demonstration Projects are:</P>
                <P>1. To increase employment retention and labor force participation of individuals who acquire, and/or are at risk of developing, work disabilities; and</P>
                <P>2. To reduce long-term work disability among RETAIN service users, including the need for Social Security Disability Insurance and Supplemental Security Income.</P>
                <P>The Retain Demonstration aims to validate and expand evidence-based strategies to accomplish these goals. DOL funds intervention approaches and programmatic technical assistance, while SSA funds evaluation support, including technical assistance and the full evaluation for the demonstration. The demonstration consists of two Phases. The first involves the implementation and assessment of cooperative awards to eight states to conduct planning and start-up activities, including the launch of a small pilot demonstration. During Phase 1, SSA provided evaluation-related technical assistance and planning, and conducts evaluability assessments to assess which states' projects would allow for a rigorous evaluation if continued beyond the pilot phase. SSA completed Phase 1 on May 16, 2021. DOL selected a subset of states and continued to Phase 2 full implementation and evaluation on May 17, 2021, which will end in October 2025. During Phase 2, DOL funds the operations and program technical assistance activities for the recommended states, and SSA funds the full set of evaluation activities. The four components of this evaluation, completed during site visits, interviews with RETAIN service users, surveys of RETAIN enrollees, and surveys of RETAIN service providers, include:</P>

                     Using RETAIN service user interviews and surveys, this analysis provides insights into which eligible workers choose to participate in the program, in what ways they participate, and how services received vary with participant characteristics. Similarly, it will assess the characteristics of, and if possible, reasons for non-enrollment of non-participants.

                     This analysis assesses whether the benefits of RETAIN justify its costs, conducted from various perspectives, including participants, state and Federal governments, SSA, and society as a whole. The purpose and proposed use of this information collection is to gather qualitative and quantitative data needed to conduct the analysis. These activities, include (1) surveys of RETAIN enrollees and (2) follow-up interviews with RETAIN service users. The qualitative data collection consists of: (1) semi-structured interviews with program staff and service users; and (2) staff activity logs. Program staff interviews focus on staff's perceptions of the successes and challenges of implementing each states program, while staff activity logs house information on staff's time to inform the benefit-cost analysis. Service user interviews inform SSA's understanding of users' experiences with program services. The quantitative data include SSA's program records and survey data. The survey data collection consists of: (1) two rounds of follow-up surveys, focusing on individual-level outcomes, with enrollees, all of whom who have experienced a disability onset; and (2) two rounds of surveys with RETAIN providers. Respondents learn of the RETAIN program data collection efforts through various outreach methods, including, but not limited to mailings, phone calls, and from other individuals. SSA is constantly reviewing our outreach strategies to ensure maximum exposure and accessibility to the materials. the respondents are staff members selected for staff interviews

                    <E T="03">1. Beyond Benefits Study (BBS)—0960–NEW.</E>
                     The BBS will provide SSA with information regarding the needs of individuals who, due to medical improvement or a change in eligibility, have “exited” (called Exiters), or are likely to “exit” (called Possible Exiters) the Social Security Disability Insurance (SSDI) program, the Supplemental Security Income (SSI) program, or both. The BBS will provide SSA with a clearer understanding of the challenges and needs of the target population as Exiters leave the safety net and security of disability benefits and attempt to return to work. SSA will use the findings from the BBS to identify potential interventions and policies to help Exiters and Possible Exiters achieve sustainable, substantial work leading to self-sufficiency.
                </P>
                <P>
                    In seeking to understand the needs (
                    <E T="03">e.g.,</E>
                     service, medical, and employment) of Exiters and Possible Exiters, the study aims to answer three primary research questions: (1) what are the service, medical, and employment needs required to achieve sustainable, substantive employment among individuals who exit SSDI/SSI programs; (2) what are the types of services, resources, and interventions that will help exiting individuals obtain and retain employment, and should SSA consider a larger test study; and (3) what policy recommendations will facilitate substantive and sustainable employment among individuals who exit SSDI/SSI programs?
                </P>
                <P>
                    The BBS will help SSA answer these questions by collecting data through surveys, interviews, and focus groups. Quantitative data collection via the survey will include 4,000 participants stratified by exit status and other criteria. The sample will include 2,000 Possible Exiters, 1,000 Short-term Exiters (have exited within the last year), and 1,000 Long-term Exiters (have exited within the last 1–5 years) with 75% of respondents in each group having a high-scoring likelihood of medical improvement based on the Continuing Disability Review (CDR) profiling model. The sample will be further stratified by program type (SSDI versus SSI) and by recommended determinants of self-sufficiency (
                    <E T="03">e.g.,</E>
                     age, type of impairment, and urban or rural locality).
                </P>
                <P>The Motivational Interviewing Pilot Test will recruit 50 Exiters to participate in six sessions. During these sessions, motivational interviewers assess each participant's readiness to return to work using a standardized screener and explore the interest and motivation relating to obtaining and retaining employment as well as career advancement. Participants who drop out after the first session will be replaced.</P>
                <P>
                    Data collection via the interviews and focus groups will include (1) qualitative in-depth interviews with Exiters and Possible Exiters (70 individuals); (2) ten focus groups with Exiters and Possible Exiters (140 individuals, total); (3) two focus groups with service providers (20 individuals, total); (4) in-depth interviews with state and agency leadership (30 individuals); and, (5) a focus group with the motivational

                    interview (MI) practitioners (five individuals).
                </P>
                <P>The respondents are individuals who have volunteered to take part in the study and are exiting (Exiters) or may be exiting (Possible Exiters) SSA's disability program(s) due to medical improvement or changes in eligibility; vocational service providers; state and agency leadership; and motivational interviewers.</P>

                     House Rule 3295, the Help America Vote Act of 2002, mandates that States verify the identities of newly registered voters. When newly registered voters do not have driver's licenses or State-issued ID cards, they must supply the last four digits of their Social Security number to their local State election agencies for verification. The election agencies forward this information to their State Motor Vehicle Administration (MVA) and the State MVA inputs the data into the American Association of MVAs, a central consolidation system that routes the voter data to SSA's Help America Vote Verification (HAVV) system. Once SSA's HAVV system confirms the identity of the voter, the information returns along the same route in reverse until it reaches the State election agency. The respondents are the State MVAs seeking to confirm voter identities.

Under this matching program, OPM will disclose civil service benefit and payment data to SSA. SSA is legally required to offset specific benefits by a percentage of civil service benefits received (Spousal and Survivors benefits, Supplemental Security Income (SSI) benefits, and Retirement and Disability Insurance Benefits are offset by a percentage of the recipients' own Federal Government pension benefits). SSA administers the Old Age, Survivors, Disability Insurance (OASDI), SSI, and Special Veterans' Benefits (SVB) programs. SSA will use the match results under this agreement to meet its civil service benefit offset obligations. SSA's Office of the Chief Actuary (OCA) will also use OPM's data for statistical and research purposes in tracking the size of, and impact on, subpopulations of government annuitants affected by the Government Pension Offset, the Windfall Elimination Provision, and in cost estimates of proposals to change the two provisions.</P>

                     The legal authority for SSA to conduct this matching activity for SSI purposes is section 1631(e)(1)(B) and (f) of the Social Security Act (Act) (42 U.S.C. 1383(e)(1)(B) and (f)). The legal authority for SVB purposes is section 806 of the Act (42 U.S.C. 1006). The legal authority for SSA to conduct this matching activity for OASDI includes section 224 of the Act (42 U.S.C. 424a), which provides for the reduction of Social Security disability benefits when the disabled worker is also entitled to a Public Disability Benefit (PDB). Also, section 215a(7)(A) of the Act (42 U.S.C. 415) requires a modification to the computation formula reducing the Primary Insurance Amount of a retired and disabled worker entitled to a pension from employment not covered under Social Security. Section 202k(5)(A) (42 U.S.C. 402) provides for the reduction of spousal and survivors benefits by a percentage of a pension received based on work not covered by Social Security.

                <P>Section 1631(f) of the Act (42 U.S.C. 1383(f)) requires Federal agencies to furnish SSA with information necessary to verify eligibility for benefits. Section 224(h)(1) of the Act (42 U.S.C. 424a(h)(1)) requires any Federal agency to provide SSA with information in its possession that SSA may require for the purposes of making a timely determination of the amount of reduction under section 224 of the Act (42 U.S.C. 424a).</P>
                <P>This agreement is executed in compliance with the Privacy Act of 1974 (5 U.S.C. 552a), as amended by the Computer Matching and Privacy Protection Act of 1988, and the regulations and guidance promulgated thereunder.</P>

SSA will use the match results under this agreement to meet its civil service benefit offset obligations. SSA is legally required to offset specific benefits by a percentage of the benefit recipients' Federal Government pension benefits.

                     The individuals whose information is involved in this matching program are those individuals who are receiving civil service benefits and payments as well as either Spousal and Survivors benefits, SSI or SVB benefits, or Retirement and Disability Insurance benefits.

                    <E T="03">Categories of Records:</E>
                     OPM will provide SSA with an electronic file containing civil service benefit and payment data from the annuity and survivor master file. Each month, OPM will provide SSA with an electronic file that will include updated payment information for new civil service annuitants and annuitants whose civil service annuity has changed. This monthly file contains approximately 25,000 records. OPM will provide SSA with the entire master annuity file of approximately 2.7 million records once yearly for the month of the civil service cost-of-living allowance. OPM will furnish SSA with the following civil service benefit and payment data: payment status code; prefix; name; Social Security number (SSN); Social Security verification code; date of birth; award date; civil service claim number; first potential month and year of eligibility; date of eligibility indicator; first month, day, and year of entitlement; disability indicator; Federal Insurance Contributions Act covered months indicator; total service months; amount of current gross civil service benefits; effective date (month, day, and year) of civil service amount; SSNs for disabled children; retroactive payments; date of death; payments that are currently coded `special pay'; OPM code that indicates OPM used pre-1957 military service in the benefit computations; actual military service dates that OPM used in computing the OPM pension amount; OPM code for voluntary contributions; amount of the pension from voluntary contributions; months of employment after 1956 not covered by Social Security that are used to determine the pension; period of employment upon which pension is based; and Federal Employees Retirement System transfer case data.
                </P>
                <P>SSA will attempt to verify the SSNs furnished by OPM using the SSA Enumeration System database and the individuals' name, date of birth, and SSN. SSA will only use verified SSNs in the matches with its systems of records (SOR). SSA will match the SSN-verified OPM data against the Supplemental Security Record or Master Beneficiary Record to identify: SSI/SVB recipients who are also receiving a civil service pension; individuals who may be subject to PDB offset; and beneficiaries subject to a Federal pension offset.</P>

                    <P>In accordance with the Paperwork Reduction Act of 1995, FAA invites public comments about our intention to request the Office of Management and Budget (OMB) approval to renew an information collection. The collection involves requirements primarily applicable to air carriers conducting domestic, flag, and supplemental operations to enhance the professional development of pilots in those operations. The action requires air carriers conducting domestic, flag, and supplemental operations to provide new-hire pilots with an opportunity to observe flight operations and become familiar with procedures before serving as a flightcrew member in operations. Additionally, it requires air carriers who have not previously revised the upgrade training to include professional development and to provide leadership and command and mentoring training for all pilots in command. The information to be collected is necessary to mitigate incidents of unprofessional pilot behavior and reduce pilot errors that can lead to a catastrophic event.</P>

                    <E T="03">Background:</E>
                     The collection involves requirements primarily applicable to air carriers conducting domestic, flag, and supplemental operations to enhance the professional development of pilots in those operations. These amendments to part 121 set out prerequisites and levy requirements that must be met by certificate holders using part 121 pilot training and qualification programs and by those individuals who serve in given capacities for those certificate holders.
                </P>
                <P>The FAA anticipates that certificate holders will incur costs for the following groups of provisions:</P>
                <P>• Operations familiarization for new-hire pilots (§ 121.435);</P>
                <P>• Leadership and command and mentoring ground training for pilots currently serving as pilot in command (PIC) (§ 121.429) and recurrent PIC leadership and command and mentoring ground training (§§ 121.409(b) and 121.427);</P>
                <P>• Leadership and command training and recurrent leadership and command training for pilots serving as second in command (SIC) in operations that require three or more pilots (§ 121.432(a));</P>
                <P>• Upgrade training curriculum requirements (§§ 121.420 and 121.426);</P>
                <P>• Part 121, Appendix H requirements; and</P>
                <P>• Approval of Qualification Standards Document for certificate holders using an Advanced Qualification Program (AQP) (§ 121.909).</P>
                <P>The development and approval of new and revised curriculums will be a one-time occurrence for each certificate holder. The documentation regarding training in leadership and command and mentoring for current PICs will be a one-time occurrence. Similarly, the documentation regarding training in leadership and command for current SICs serving in operations that require three or more pilots will be a one-time occurrence. The documentation of operations familiarization for new-hire pilots will occur once for each new-hire pilot. The documentation of recurrent PIC leadership and command and mentoring training will occur every three years for each PIC. The documentation of recurrent leadership and command training for SICs serving in operations that require three or more pilots will occur every three years for each such SIC.</P>

                     The 
                    <E T="04">Federal Register</E>
                     Notice with a 60-day comment period soliciting comments on the following collection of information was published on August 7, 2023 (88 FR 52240). In 2018, Congress passed the FAA Reauthorization Act of 2018 (Pub. L. 115–254). Section 44809 of Public Law 115–254 allows a person to operate a small unmanned aircraft (UA) without specific certification or operating authority from the FAA if the operation adheres to certain limitations. These limitations require the FAA to recognize community-based organizations (CBOs), develop and administer an aeronautical knowledge and safety test, establish fixed flying sites, approve standards and limitations for unmanned aircraft weighing more than 55 pounds, and designate FAA Recognized Identification Areas (FRIAs).
                </P>
                <P>The information will be collected online, primarily through the FAA's DroneZone website. The information collected will be limited to only that necessary for the FAA to complete a review of an application under the following statutory requirements:</P>

                <FP SOURCE="FP-1">• Section 44809(i), Recognition of Community-Based Organizations</FP>
                <P>
                    <E T="03">Respondents:</E>
                     The FAA estimates that there will be approximately 1,143 respondents per year. Respondents comprise individuals and organizations operating under the Exception for Limited Recreational Operations of Unmanned Aircraft who wish to be recognized as CBOs, administer the aeronautical knowledge and safety test, establish fixed flying sites, have standards and limitations for unmanned aircraft weighing more than 55 pounds approved, and establish designated FRIAs.
                </P>
                <P>
                    <E T="03">Frequency:</E>

                <P>
                    <E T="03">Estimated Average Burden per Response:</E>
                     Varies depending on the type of stakeholder application. Fixed flying site applications (including more than 55 pound UAS and FRIA) are estimated to take 0.5 hours per applicant. CBO recognition and more than 55 pound UAS standards and limitations applications are estimated to take 1.0 hours per applicant.

                    <E T="03">Background:</E>
                     US Department of Transportation (USDOT) is directed to complete a survey and comparative assessment of truck parking facilities in each State as required by section 1401(c) of 
                    <E T="03">Moving Ahead for Progress in the 21st Century</E>
                     (MAP–21). MAP–21 section 1401(c) required the survey in order to evaluate the capability of the States to provide adequate parking and rest facilities for commercial motor vehicles engaged in interstate transportation. Other work activities required under this section of MAP–21 were: an assessment of the volume of commercial motor vehicle traffic in each State and the development of a system of metrics designed to measure the adequacy of commercial motor vehicle truck parking facilities in each state. A survey was conducted in 2014 and is available at: 
                    <E T="03">https://ops.fhwa.dot.gov/freight/infrastructure/truck_parking/jasons_law/truckparkingsurvey/index.htm.</E>
                     A second survey was conducted in 2019 and a presentation of the results is available at: 
                    <E T="03">https://ops.fhwa.dot.gov/Freight/infrastructure/truck_parking/coalition/2020/mtg/jasons_law_results.pdf</E>
                    . MAP–21 section 1401(c)(3) called for periodic updates to the survey, which is the intent of the proposed updated survey. The results of this updated survey shall be made available on a publicly accessible Department of Transportation website and updated periodically USDOT seeks to continue to collect data to support updates to the survey.
                </P>
                <P>
                    <E T="03">Respondents:</E>
                     State Transportation and Enforcement Officials, Port Authorities, Private Sector Facility Owners/Operators, Trucking Company owners or their designee, and Truck Drivers. The target groups of respondents are individuals who are responsible for providing or overseeing the operation of truck parking facilities and stakeholders that depend on such facilities to safely conduct their business. The target group identified in the legislation is “state commercial vehicle safety personnel;” the Federal Highway Administration (FHWA) has interpreted this term to include the Department of Transportation personnel in each State involved in commercial vehicle safety program activities and State enforcement agency personnel directly involved in enforcing highway safety laws and regulations and in highway incident and accident response. FHWA recognizes the importance of ports when discussing this topic; input from Port Authorities must be obtained to complete the public inventory. In addition, FHWA finds that the survey on the adequacy of truck parking opportunities is not limited to publicly owned facilities; input from private sector facility owners/operators must be obtained to adequately complete the required work provided in the federal legislation. FHWA also finds that input obtained from trucking company representatives (owners or their designees, especially those in logistics or who schedule drivers) and truck drivers, key stakeholders for truck parking facilities who are most likely to know where truck parking is needed, will be necessary to complete the survey requirements. As per MAP–21 section 1401(c)(3), this survey will be conducted periodically to allow for required updates.

                <P>
                    <E T="03">Types of Survey Questions:</E>
                     FHWA intends to survey Department of Transportation personnel in each State on the location, number of spaces, availability and demand for truck parking in their State, including at rest facilities, truck parking information systems, truck parking plans, as well as any impediments to providing adequate truck parking capacity (including but not limited to legislative, regulatory, or financial issues; zoning; public and private impacts, approval, and participation; availability of land; insurance requirements and other issues). FHWA intends to survey Port Authority personnel on number of spaces, availability, and demand for truck parking at their facility, truck parking information systems, reservation systems, as well as future plans for expansion or reduction of truck parking. FHWA intends to survey private truck stop operators in each State on the location, number of truck parking spaces, availability and demand they observe at their facilities. FHWA intends to survey public safety officials in each State on their records and observations of truck parking use and patterns, including the location and frequency of trucks parked adjacent to roadways and on exit and entrance ramps to roadway facilities. FHWA intends to survey trucking companies and truck drivers regarding the location and frequency of insufficient truck parking and capacity at rest facilities, future truck parking needs and locations, availability of information on truck parking capacity, and other impediments to identification, access and use of truck parking. Other questions may be included as needed as a result of input from the focus groups, stakeholder outreach or at FHWA's discretion, or as follow-up to the survey.

                <P>The FAA Modernization and Reform Act (Act), which was signed into law on February 14, 2012, requires U.S. carriers that operate scheduled passenger service or public charter service using any aircraft with a design capacity of 30 or more seats, and operators of large hub, medium hub, small hub, or non-hub U.S. airports, to submit emergency contingency plans for lengthy tarmac delays to the Secretary of Transportation for review and approval. In addition to requiring the initial submission of emergency contingency plans, the Act requires U.S. air carriers to submit an updated plan every 3 years and U.S. airport operators to submit an updated plan every 5 years. The Act further requires each covered carrier and airport to ensure public access to its plan after DOT approval by posting the plan on its website.</P>
                <P>
                    DOT has an online system allowing covered U.S. air carriers and U.S. airports to submit plans online.

                     On June 2, 2015, DOT published a 60-day FR Notice to renew/reinstate the OMB control number (80 FR 31455) and on June 17, 2016, a 30-day FR notice was published (81 FR 39750). On February 23, 2017, OMB reinstated the OMB control number, which expired on February 29, 2020. DOT is issuing this 60-day notice to reinstate the OMB control number.

                <P>The Paperwork Reduction Act of 1995 (PRA) and its implementing regulations, 5 CFR part 1320, require Federal agencies to issue two notices, a 60-day notice followed by a 30-day notice, seeking public comment on information collection activities before OMB may approve paperwork packages. A Federal agency generally cannot conduct or sponsor a collection of information, and the public is generally not required to respond to an information collection, unless it is approved by the OMB under the PRA and displays a currently valid OMB Control Number. In addition, notwithstanding any other provisions of law, no person shall generally be subject to monetary penalty for failing to comply with a collection of information if the collection of information does not display a valid OMB Control Number. See 5 CFR 1320.5(a) and 1320.6.</P>

                    For U.S. airports—195.5 hours (391 existing airports × .5 hours = 195.5 hours). This estimate is based on the following facts/assumptions: Tarmac delay plans for submission are general in nature and do not consist of extensive airport-specific customization. Airport associations prepared templates for use by U.S. airports which require very little additional information to be customized for individual airports and have been the templates for most of the airport plans submitted. For U.S. airports that have already prepared and submitted a plan and will continue to be subject to this requirement, they will need to review and update the plan through the DOT's electronic submission system. We estimate .5 hour for these 391 airports to review, update, and submit the plan through the DOT's electronic submission system.

                        <SU>5</SU>
                         The total number of airports required to submit plans has decreased from 401 to 391 (-10 airports). The burden is calculated with the assumption that no new airports need to submit a plan. However, if there are any new airports that are required to submit a plan, the burden estimate for such an airport would be two hours.
                    </P>
                </FTNT>
                <P>
                    For U.S. airlines—54.5 hours [(65 existing carriers × .5 hours = 32.5 hours) + (11 new carrier × 2 hours = 22 hours) = 54.5 hours]. Although airlines often choose to prepare more detailed plans for internal use, airline plans for submission generally are not very detailed and provide only the level of information required to meet the statutory requirement. In addition, currently operating U.S. carriers are already required to have such plans in place as this is a continuing requirement and the statute has been in place since 2012. Therefore, we estimate that the 65 covered U.S. carriers will spend .5 hour to review, update, and submit the plan through the DOT's electronic submission system. For the 11 carriers that had not prepared and submitted a plan to meet the requirement in 2017, we estimate 2 hours to review and prepare the templates, and to submit the plan through the DOT's electronic submission system.

                    Section 17A(c) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 (the Act) requires all transfer agents for qualifying securities registered under section 12 of the Act, as well as for securities that

                    would be required to be registered except for the exemption from registration provided by section 12(g)(2)(B) or section 12(g)(2)(G), to file with the appropriate regulatory agency (ARA) an application for registration in such form and containing such information and documents as such appropriate regulatory agency may prescribe as necessary or appropriate in furtherance of the purposes of this section.

                     In general, an entity performing transfer agent functions for a qualifying security is required to register with its appropriate regulatory agency. The OCC's regulations at 12 CFR 9.20 implement these provisions of the Act.

                    To accomplish the registration of transfer agents, Form TA–1 was developed in 1975 as an interagency effort by the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) and the Federal banking agencies (the OCC, the Board of Governors of the Federal Reserve System, and the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation). The agencies primarily use the data collected on Form TA–1 to determine whether an application for registration should be approved, denied, accelerated, or postponed, and they use the data in connection with their supervisory responsibilities. In addition, when a national bank or Federal savings association no longer acts as a transfer agent for qualifying securities or when the national bank or Federal savings association is no longer supervised by the OCC, 
                    <E T="03">i.e.,</E>
                     liquidates or converts to another form of financial institution, the national bank or Federal savings association must file Form TA–W with the OCC, requesting withdrawal from registration as a transfer agent.
                </P>
                <P>Forms TA–1 and TA–W are mandatory, and their collection is authorized by sections 17A(c), 17(a)(3), and 23(a)(1) of the Act, as amended (15 U.S.C. 78q–1(c), 78q(a)(3), and 78w(a)(1)). Additionally, section 3(a)(34)(B)(i) of the Act (15 U.S.C. 78c(a)(34)(B)(i)) provides that the OCC is the ARA in the case of a national banks and Federal savings associations and subsidiaries of such institutions. The registrations are public filings and are not considered confidential. The OCC needs the information contained in this collection to fulfill its statutory responsibilities. Section 17A(c)(2) of the Act (15 U.S.C. 78q–1(c)(2)), as amended, provides that all those authorized to transfer securities registered under section 12 of the Act (transfer agents) shall register by filing with the appropriate regulatory agency an application for registration in such form and containing such information and documents as such appropriate regulatory agency may prescribe to be necessary or appropriate in furtherance of the purposes of this section.</P>

                     The OCC is seeking renewal with revision of an information collection approval for the recordkeeping, reporting, and disclosure requirements associated with capital adequacy standards applicable to national banks and Federal savings associations. The OCC is proposing revisions in connection with this extension to reflect more granular detail for certain existing reporting and recordkeeping provisions and is improving prior estimates regarding the number of respondents and burden associated with these existing provisions. In addition, reporting burden associated with 12 CFR 3.304 is being removed as that portion of the rule is no longer in effect.

                </P>
                <P>Section 3.62 sets forth disclosure requirements related to the capital requirements of a national bank or Federal savings association. Section 3.61 provides that these requirements apply to an institution with total consolidated assets of $50 billion or more that is not a consolidated subsidiary of a bank holding company, savings and loan holding company, or a depository institution subject to the disclosure requirements of § 3.62. For national banks or Federal savings associations subject to the disclosure requirements, § 3.62(a) requires quarterly disclosure of information in the applicable tables in § 3.63 and, if a significant change occurs, such that the most recent reported amounts are no longer reflective of the institution's capital adequacy and risk profile, § 3.62(a) requires the national bank or Federal savings association to disclose as soon as practicable thereafter a brief discussion of the change and its likely impact. Section 3.62(a) also permits annual disclosure of qualitative information that typically does not change each quarter, provided that any significant changes are disclosed in the interim.</P>
                <P>Section 3.62(b) requires that a national bank or Federal savings association have a formal disclosure policy approved by the board of directors that addresses its approach for determining the disclosures it makes. The policy must address the associated internal controls and disclosure controls and procedures. Section 3.62(c) permits a national bank or Federal savings association to disclose more general information about certain subjects if the national bank or Federal savings association concludes that the specific commercial or financial information required to be disclosed under § 3.62 is exempt from disclosure under the Freedom of Information Act (5 U.S.C. 552) and the national bank or Federal savings association provides the reason the specific items of information have not been disclosed.</P>
                <P>Currently, § 3.63 sets forth the specific disclosure requirements for a non-advanced approaches national bank or Federal savings association with total consolidated assets of $50 billion or more that is not a consolidated subsidiary of a bank holding company, savings and loan holding company, or a depository institution subject to the disclosure requirements of § 3.62. Section 3.63(a) requires those institutions to make the disclosures in Tables 1 through 10 in § 3.63 and in § 3.63(b) for each of the last three years beginning on the effective date of the rule. Section 3.63(b) requires quarterly disclosure of an institution's common equity tier 1 capital, additional tier 1 capital, tier 2 capital, tier 1 and total capital ratios, including the regulatory capital elements and all the regulatory adjustments and deductions needed to calculate the numerator of such ratios; total risk-weighted assets, including the different regulatory adjustments and deductions needed to calculate total risk-weighted assets; regulatory capital ratios during any transition periods, including a description of all the regulatory capital elements and all regulatory adjustments and deductions needed to calculate the numerator and denominator of each capital ratio during any transition period; and a reconciliation of regulatory capital elements as they relate to its balance sheet in any audited consolidated financial statements. Tables 1 through 10 in § 3.63 set forth qualitative and/or quantitative requirements for scope of application, capital structure, capital adequacy, capital conservation buffer, credit risk, counterparty credit risk-related exposures, credit risk mitigation, securitizations, equities not subject to Subpart F (Market Risk requirements) of the rule, and interest rate risk for non-trading activities.</P>

With the prior written approval of the OCC, a national bank or Federal savings association may calculate haircuts using its own internal estimates of the volatilities of market prices and foreign exchange rates. The

                <P>Section 3.132(b)(3) covers counterparty credit risk of repo-style transactions, eligible margin loans, OTC derivative contracts, and simple Value-at-Risk (VaR) methodology. With the prior written approval of the OCC, a national bank or Federal savings association may estimate exposure at default (EAD) for a netting set using a VaR model that meets certain requirements.</P>
                <P>Section 3.132(d)(1)(i) permits the use of the internal models methodology (IMM) to determine EAD for counterparty credit risk for derivative contracts with prior written approval from the OCC.</P>

                <P>Section 3.132(d)(2) addresses counterparty credit risk of repo-style transactions, eligible margin loans, and OTC derivative contracts, and risk-weighted assets using IMM. Under the IMM, an institution uses an internal model to estimate the expected exposure (EE) for a netting set and then calculates EAD based on that EE. A national bank or Federal savings association must calculate two EEs and two EADs (one stressed and one unstressed) for each netting as outlined in this section. Section 3.132(d)(2)(iv) provides that a national bank or Federal savings association may use a conservative measure of EAD subject to prior written approval of the OCC.</P>
                <P>Section 3.153(b) outlines the Internal Models Approach (IMA) for calculating risk-weighted assets for equity exposures and specifies that a national bank or Federal savings association must receive prior written approval from the OCC before it can use IMA by demonstrating to the OCC that the national bank or Federal savings association meets certain criteria.</P>

                <P>Section 3.121 requires a national bank or Federal savings association subject to the advanced approaches risk-based capital requirements to adopt a written implementation plan to address how it will comply with the advanced capital adequacy framework's qualification requirements and also develop and maintain a comprehensive and sound planning and governance process to oversee the implementation efforts described in the plan. Section 3.122 further requires these institutions to: develop processes for assessing capital adequacy in relation to an organization's risk profile; establish and maintain internal risk rating and segmentation systems for wholesale and retail risk exposures, including comprehensive risk parameter quantification processes and processes for annual reviews and analyses of reference data to determine their relevance; document their processes for identifying, measuring, monitoring, controlling, and internally reporting operational risk; verify the accurate and timely reporting of risk-based capital requirements; and monitor, validate, and refine their advanced systems.  </P>
                <P>Section 3.132(d)(3)(vi) addresses counterparty credit risk of repo-style transactions, eligible margin loans, and OTC derivative contracts. To obtain OCC approval to calculate the distributions of exposures upon which the EAD calculation is based, a national bank or Federal savings association must demonstrate to the satisfaction of the OCC that it has been using for at least one year an internal model that broadly meets the minimum standards with which the national bank or Federal savings association must maintain compliance. The national bank or Federal savings association must have procedures to identify, monitor, and control wrong-way risk throughout the life of an exposure and they must include stress testing and scenario analysis.</P>
                <P>Section 3.132(d)(3)(viii) addresses counterparty credit risk of repo-style transactions, eligible margin loans, and OTC derivative contracts. When estimating model parameters based on a stress period, a national bank or Federal savings association must use at least three years of historical data that include a period of stress to the credit default spreads of its counterparties. The national bank or Federal savings association must review the data set and update the data as necessary, particularly for any material changes in its counterparties. The national bank or Federal savings association must demonstrate at least quarterly that the stress period coincides with increased credit default swap (CDS) or other credit spreads of the institution's counterparties. The national bank or Federal savings association must have procedures to evaluate the effectiveness of its stress calibration that include a process for using benchmark portfolios that are vulnerable to the same risk factors as the national bank's or Federal savings association's portfolio. The OCC may require the institution to modify its stress calibration to better reflect actual historic losses of the portfolio.</P>
                <P>Section 3.132(d)(3)(ix), regarding counterparty credit risk of repo-style transactions, eligible margin loans, and OTC derivative contracts, requires that a national bank or Federal savings association must subject its internal model to an initial validation and annual model review process that includes consideration of whether the inputs and risk factors, as well as the model outputs, are appropriate. The section requires national banks and Federal savings associations to have a backtesting program for its model that includes a process by which unacceptable model performance will be determined and remedied.</P>
                <P>Section 3.132(d)(3)(x), regarding counterparty credit risk of repo-style transactions, eligible margin loans, and OTC derivative contracts, provides that a national bank or Federal savings association must have policies for the measurement, management, and control of collateral and margin amounts.</P>

                         The SAR regulatory reporting requirements are currently covered under the following OMB control numbers: 1506–0001 (31 CFR 1020.320—Reports by banks of suspicious transactions); 1506–0006 (31 CFR 1021.320—Reports by casinos of suspicious transactions); 1506–0015 (31 CFR 1022.320—Reports by money services businesses of suspicious transactions); 1506–0019 (31 CFR 1023.320—Reports by brokers or dealers in securities of suspicious transactions, 31 CFR 1024.320—Reports by mutual funds of suspicious transactions, and 31 CFR 1026.320—Reports by futures commission merchants and introducing brokers in commodities of suspicious transactions); 1506–0029 (31 CFR 1025.320—Reports by insurance companies of suspicious transactions); and 1506–0061 (31 CFR 1029.320—Reports by loan or finance companies of suspicious transactions). The PRA does not apply to reports by one government entity to another government entity. For that reason, there is no OMB control number associated with 31 CFR 1030.320—Reports of suspicious transactions by housing government sponsored enterprises. OMB control number 1506–0065 applies to FinCEN Report 111—SAR. An administrative burden of one hour is assigned to each of the SAR regulation OMB control numbers to maintain the requirements in force.

                     On May 26, 2020, FinCEN issued a 60-day notice to renew the SAR OMB controls numbers (“2020 Notice”). In the 2020 Notice, FinCEN proposed to expand the scope of factors to consider as part of the PRA burden of complying with SAR requirements. In addition, as described in the 2020 Notice, to better estimate the burden associated with complying with SAR requirements, FinCEN conducted an in-depth analysis of the population of 2019 SAR filing statistics. FinCEN analyzed the 2019 SAR filings grouped by a number of different factors, including the following: (i) the distribution of SAR submissions by type of filing (original or continuing SAR); (ii) the filer's financial institution type; (iii) how many SARs the filer filed in a year; (iv) the method of filing (batch filing versus discrete filing); (v) the SAR narrative length; and (vi) the number of suspicious activities per report. The analysis and calculations detailed in the 2020 Notice ultimately resulted in an estimate of approximately 1.98 hours in filer burden per SAR.

                <P>FinCEN received 22 public comments in response to the 2020 Notice. Commenters were generally supportive of FinCEN's efforts to more accurately estimate the PRA burden associated with the SAR filing requirements. Some commenters had specific recommendations regarding factors for FinCEN to consider in future in-depth analysis of the SAR filing population. However, none of those commenters provided specific sources of data to contradict the burden estimate of 1.98 hours of burden per SAR filed. In the absence of public comments to suggest otherwise, FinCEN considers it reasonable to continue to use the estimate of 1.98 hours per SAR filed for the population of 2022 SAR filing statistics as outlined in this notice. In connection with a variety of initiatives FinCEN is undertaking to implement the AML Act, FinCEN intends to conduct, in the future, additional assessments of the PRA burden associated with BSA requirements, including SAR requirements.</P>

                     VA Form 21–509 is the prescribed form used by VBA to gather income and dependency information from claimants who are seeking payment of benefits as, or for dependent parent(s). VA Form 21–509 is used by a Veteran seeking to establish their parent(s) as dependent(s) and by a surviving parent seeking death compensation. This information is used to determine the dependency of the parent and make determinations which affect the payment of monetary benefits to the claimant. Without this information, determination of entitlement would not be possible. No changes have been made to this form. The respondent burden has decreased due to the estimated number of receivables averaged over the past year.

                     VA Form 26–1852 is completed by builders in Specially Adapted Housing (SAH) projects involving construction as authorized under Title 38, U.S.C., section 2101(a), section 2101(b), and the Temporary Residence Adaptations (TRA) grant under Title 38, U.S.C., section 2102A. This form is also completed by builders who propose to construct homes to be purchased by veterans using their VA home loan benefit as granted in Title 38 U.S.C., section 3710(a)(1). SAH field staff review the data furnished on the form for completeness and it is essential to determine the acceptability of the construction materials to be used. In cases of new home construction, a technically qualified individual, not VA staff, is required to review the list of materials and certify they meet or exceed general residential construction material requirements, as specified by the International Residential Code and residential building codes adopted by local building authorities, and are in substantial conformity with VA Minimum Property requirements.

                <PRES>By the President of the United States of America</PRES>
                <PROC>A Proclamation</PROC>
                <FP>I have always believed that the promise of America is big enough for everyone to succeed and that it is each generation's responsibility to open the doors of opportunity just a little bit wider to include those who have been left behind. During National Tribal Colleges and Universities Week, we honor and celebrate these critical institutions for doing just that: providing opportunities for students and their communities throughout Indian Country.</FP>
                <FP>A quality education can transform lives and give students the power to shape their future. But we know that not everyone has a fair shot at pursuing higher education—including many Native American students. We know that promoting educational opportunities is all the more important for Native people, after over a century of Federal assimilation policies that used education as a tool of cultural and physical violence—devastating Native communities and ripping Native families apart. We have seen time and again that Tribal Colleges and Universities uplift Native American students through culturally grounded education and put them on a path toward a brighter future. That is why my Administration has been working relentlessly to provide these institutions with the support they need to thrive.</FP>
                <FP>During my first year in office, I was proud to issue an Executive Order on the White House Initiative on Advancing Educational Equity, Excellence, and Economic Opportunity for Native Americans and Strengthening Tribal Colleges and Universities. This initiative directs the Secretary of Education, the Secretary of the Interior, and the Secretary of Labor to collaborate with leaders from Tribal Nations to advance educational equity, excellence, and economic opportunity for Native American students. We are also investing millions of dollars to provide Tribal Colleges and Universities with the resources they deserve.</FP>
                <FP>My Administration has also been working to make higher education more affordable for all students. To date, we have worked with the Congress to increase the maximum Pell Grant by $900—making it easier for millions of students to pay for school. We have also fixed the Public Service Loan Forgiveness program to ensure that students who become public servants receive the debt relief they are entitled to under the law. Through our Saving on a Valuable Education Plan, we are cutting payments for undergraduate loans in half, providing early forgiveness to many borrowers with low balance loans, and saving the typical borrower around $1,000 per year. We are pursuing new actions to relieve the burden of student debt for as many borrowers as we can, as fast as we can.</FP>
                <FP>Every child in America has a dream. It is our responsibility to give them the opportunity to make those dreams a reality. This National Tribal Colleges and Universities Week, let us recommit to supporting these centers of academic excellence as they empower young Native American leaders to pursue their loftiest ambitions and build an America we can all be proud of.</FP>
                <FP>
                    NOW, THEREFORE, I, JOSEPH R. BIDEN JR., President of the United States of America, by virtue of the authority vested in me by the Constitution and the laws of the United States, do hereby proclaim February 4 through February 10, 2024, as National Tribal Colleges and Universities Week.
                    <PRTPAGE P="9740"/>
                </FP>

                        <P>We, the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service, are revising the regulations for the issuance of permits for eagle incidental take and eagle nest take. The purpose of these revisions is to increase the efficiency and effectiveness of permitting, improve clarity for the regulated community, and increase the conservation benefit for eagles. In addition to continuing to authorize specific permits, we created general permits for certain activities under prescribed conditions, including general permit options for qualifying wind-energy generation projects, power line infrastructure, activities that may disturb breeding bald eagles, and bald eagle nest take. We also made improvements to the specific permit requirements and process. We also revised permit fees and clarified definitions.</P>

                    <P>
                        The U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service (Service) is the Federal agency delegated with the primary responsibility for managing bald eagles (
                        <E T="03">Haliaeetus leucocephalus</E>
                        ) and golden eagles (
                        <E T="03">Aquila chrysaetos</E>
                        ) under the Bald and Golden Eagle Protection Act 16 U.S.C. 668–668d; [hereinafter the “Eagle Act”]). The Eagle Act prohibits the take, possession, and transportation of bald eagles and golden eagles except pursuant to Federal regulations. The Eagle Act authorizes the Secretary of the Interior to issue regulations to permit the “taking” of eagles for various purposes, including when “necessary . . . for the protection of other interests in any particular locality,” provided the taking is compatible with the preservation of eagles (16 U.S.C. 668a). Regulations pertaining to eagle permits are set forth in title 50 of the Code of Federal Regulations (CFR) at 50 CFR part 22. These regulations authorize the take of eagles by an activity: They do not purport to nor can they authorize the underlying activity itself.
                    </P>
                    <P>
                        In 2009, subsequent to the delisting of the bald eagle from the List of Endangered and Threatened Wildlife at 50 CFR 17.11, the Service promulgated regulations (74 FR 46836, Sept. 11, 2009 [hereinafter the “2009 Eagle Rule”]) at 50 CFR part 22 that established two new permit types for the incidental take of eagles and eagle nests. Incidental take means foreseeable take that results from, but is not the purpose of, an activity. These regulations were revised in 2016 (81 FR 91494, December 16, 2016 [hereinafter the “2016 Eagle Rule”]) to extend tenure, update the Service's Eagle Management Unit (EMU) boundaries, require preconstruction monitoring for wind-energy projects, and to amend the preservation standard. The 2016 Eagle Rule was supported by a programmatic environmental impact statement (PEIS), and the Service's final decision was described in a record of decision, both of which are available at 
                        <E T="03">https://www.regulations.gov</E>
                         in Docket No. FWS–R9–MB–2011–0094.
                    </P>
                    <P>
                        On September 14, 2021, the Service published an advance notice of proposed rulemaking (ANPR) to inform the public of changes the Service is considering that expedite and simplify the permit process authorizing incidental take of eagles (86 FR 51094). The ANPR also advised the public that the Service may prepare a draft environmental review pursuant to the National Environmental Policy Act of 1969, as amended. In the ANPR, we invited input from Tribes, Federal agencies, State agencies, nongovernmental organizations, and the general public for any pertinent issues we should address, including alternatives to our proposed approach for authorizing eagle incidental take. The public comment period closed on October 29, 2021. The Service used these comments to prepare a proposed rule and a draft environmental assessment (DEA) which we released on September 30, 2022 (87 FR 59598). The 60-day public comment period was extended to December 29, 2022 (87 FR 72957, November 28, 2022). The DEA and proposed rule are available in Docket No. FWS–HQ–MB–2020–0023 (available at 
                        <E T="03">https://www.regulations.gov</E>
                        ).
                    </P>
                    <P>
                        Comments and materials we received, as well as supporting documentation we use in preparing the environmental analysis, are available for public inspection. For more information on public comments see the

                         below. The Service also announces the availability of the finding of no significant impact (FONSI) for the Service's final environmental assessment (FEA). The FONSI is the final step in the National Environmental Policy Act (NEPA) process for this eagle rulemaking action, which includes revisions to the regulations governing permits for incidental take of eagles and take of eagle nests. The FONSI and FEA are available in Docket No. FWS–HQ–

                        MB–2020–0023 (available at 
                        <E T="03">https://www.regulations.gov</E>
                        ).
                    </P>
                    <P>With this rulemaking, we do not change the 2016 preservation standard or PEIS management objectives. The Eagle Act and existing regulations require that any authorized take of eagles be “compatible with the preservation” of bald and golden eagles (16 U.S.C. 668a). Under existing regulations, the preservation standard is defined as consistent with the goals of maintaining stable or increasing breeding populations in all eagle management units and the persistence of local populations throughout the geographic range of each species (50 CFR 22.6).  </P>
                    <P>In 2009, the Service adopted different management criteria for bald eagles and golden eagles because of the different population statuses and growth rates of each species. We determined this approach is necessary both to achieve the preservation standard and to avoid being unnecessarily restrictive. We do not alter this approach with this rulemaking. In this rulemaking, the Service uses the recently updated population-size estimates and allowable take limits for bald eagles (87 FR 5493, February 1, 2022).</P>
                    <HD SOURCE="HD1">This Rulemaking</HD>
                    <HD SOURCE="HD2">Overview</HD>
                    <P>The Service creates a new subpart E within 50 CFR part 22 for eagle permit regulations authorizing take that is necessary for the protection of other interests in any particular locality (eagle take for other interests). This new subpart includes revised provisions for processing specific permits and creates general permits. General permits authorize incidental take by activity type that occur frequently enough for the Service to have developed a standardized approach to permitting and ensure permitting is consistent with the preservation standard. These regulations also restructure the existing specific permit regulations. These regulations apply, regardless of whether infrastructure is constructed before or after the final regulations.</P>
                    <P>We amend these regulations to better align with the purpose and need described in the 2016 PEIS. In the 2016 Eagle Rule, the Service sought to:</P>
                    <P>(1) increase compliance by simplifying the permitting framework and increasing certainty;</P>
                    <P>(2) allow for consistent and efficient administration of the program by Service staff;</P>
                    <P>(3) regulate based on best available science and data; and</P>
                    <P>(4) enhance protection of eagles throughout their ranges by increasing implementation of avoidance, minimization, and mitigation of adverse impacts from human activities.</P>
                    <P>In this rulemaking, we create a new subpart E for regulations governing the permitting of eagle take for other interests. We adopt two regulations for administering permitting: specific permits (§ 22.200) and general permits (§ 22.210). We further specify activity-specific eligibility criteria and permit requirements in four sections based on activity and type of eagle take:</P>
                    <P>• incidental take for permitting wind energy (§ 22.250),</P>
                    <P>• incidental take for permitting power lines (§ 22.260),</P>
                    <P>• disturbance take (§ 22.280), and</P>
                    <P>• nest take (§ 22.300).</P>
                    <P>For clarity and consistency, we have also moved regulatory content on permit conditions to a new section (§ 22.215) and content on compensatory mitigation standards to a new section (§ 22.220). We have created new definitions to define “general permit” and “incidental take” and included clarifying modifications to the definitions of “eagle management unit,” “eagle nest,” and “in-use nest” (§ 22.6). We have redesignated related regulations pertaining to permit requirements for take of golden eagle nests (moved from § 22.75 to § 22.325) and permits for bald eagle take exempted under the Endangered Species Act (moved from § 22.90 to § 22.400) to a new subpart E, with only the modification of a nonsubstantive change to the section title for § 22.325. Finally, we have adopted administrative updates to 50 CFR part 13, General Permit Procedures, to update the text regarding information-collection requirements and the table of application fees. These changes to the designated section numbers for previous regulations are as follows:</P>

                    <P>Under these new and updated regulations, the Service will authorize eagle take using general permits and specific permits. General permits simplify and expedite the permitting process for activities that have relatively consistent and low risk to eagles and well-established avoidance, minimization, and compensatory mitigation measures. General-permit applicants self-identify eligibility and register with the Service. This includes providing required application information and fees and certifying that they meet eligibility criteria and will implement permit conditions and reporting requirements.</P>
                    <P>
                        The Service will implement general permits for the following activities: (1) certain categories of bald eagle nest take, (2) certain activities that may cause bald eagle disturbance take, (3) eagle incidental take associated with power line infrastructure, and (4) eagle incidental take associated with certain wind energy projects. These are described in more detail in the following sections. The Service will audit general permits to ensure applicants are appropriately interpreting and applying eligibility criteria and complying with permit conditions. Audits will include reviewing submitted application materials and reports. The Service will also request and review any plans or strategies 
                        <PRTPAGE P="9922"/>
                        required by permit conditions, like adaptive management plans.
                    </P>
                    <P>The Service will continue to issue specific permits, which require submission of application materials to the Service for review and development of permit conditions. To maintain a review process adequate to meet the preservation standard for eagles, the Service retains the specific-permit approach for situations that have increased or uncertain risks to eagles. The applicant is responsible for submitting a qualifying application. The Service will determine, based on the materials provided, whether the application meets regulatory requirements. The Service is responsible for identifying and using the best available information in making these determinations. If an applicant is unable to meet Service data standards in applying, the Service may waive these data standards provided: (1) the application otherwise meets issuance criteria, (2) the Service has adequate information to estimate take, and (3) the waiver will be consistent with preservation of the eagle species. There is no process to petition the Service for a waiver; rather, this process will be at the Service's discretion and documented in the permit file. Specific permit conditions must meet or exceed the requirements of general permits, except when not practicable or when site-specific data warrants customization.</P>
                    <P>If the best available information indicates that continuing implementation of a general permit program is inconsistent with the preservation of bald eagles or golden eagles, the Service may suspend the general permit program temporarily or indefinitely. This suspension may apply to all or part of general-permit authorizations. Consistent with 50 CFR part 21 and part 22 permitting, Tribes or States may choose to be more restrictive than Federal regulations. Permittees must comply with Tribal and State laws and regulations to be in compliance with Federal eagle permits.</P>
                    <HD SOURCE="HD2">Eagle Incidental Take Permits for Wind Energy</HD>
                    <P>With this rulemaking, the Service seeks to implement efficiencies in authorizing incidental take associated with wind energy projects. This final rule creates a general permit option for projects in areas that are low risk to eagles. We also revise the specific permit process to provide clarity to applicants and ensure processing is efficient and consistent with the preservation standard. With broader participation in permitting, the Service anticipates increased benefits to eagle populations as more projects implement avoidance, minimization, and mitigation measures.</P>
                    <P>
                        The Service uses a combination of eagle relative abundance and proximity to eagle nests as eligibility criteria for wind energy general permits. The Service uses the Cornell Status and Trends definition of relative abundance and relative abundance products (Cornell Lab of Ornithology, Ithaca, New York, available at: 
                        <E T="03">https://science.ebird.org/en/status-and-trends</E>
                        ). Relative abundance values determined for a project must be based on these publicly available Status and Trends relative abundance products for bald eagles and golden eagles. To help project proponents quickly determine eagle relative abundance, the Service will maintain an online mapping tool (
                        <E T="03">https://arcg.is/CKLKy1</E>
                        ).  
                    </P>
                    <P>For first-time applicants, general-permit eligibility is based on eagle relative abundance and proximity to eagle nests at the time of application. All turbines must be located in an area with eagle relative abundance less than the threshold identified by regulation (§ 22.250(c)(1)(ii) for both bald eagles and golden eagles). All turbines, including the space occupied by blades or other turbine infrastructure, must also be located at least 2 miles from a golden eagle nest and at least 660 feet from a bald eagle nest (§ 22.250(c)(1)(i)). Project proponents are expected to survey for eagle nests with due diligence and in accordance with any Service guidance for nest surveys.</P>
                    <P>The Service considered allowing general permit applicants to select authorization for just one species. By requiring both species, the Service is able to reduce administration costs and keep the general permit process simple. Both species are widely distributed and co-occur in most States. The Service recognizes that the risk to each species is not uniform, and we factored in the relative risk to each species into the relative abundance criteria, the nest buffers, and the compensatory mitigation requirements.</P>
                    <P>The Service added an eligibility criterion for wind energy projects that are renewing a general permit (§ 22.250(c)). A general permittee remains eligible to renew their permit, even if the Service revises eagle relative abundance thresholds or eagles construct a nest within the species-specific setback distances, as long as the project remains in compliance with all other general permit requirements. This includes provisions regarding the discovery of eagle remains or injured eagles remaining fewer than four eagles of the same species within a 5-year permit tenure (§ 22.210(b)(2)(i)). This eligibility applies to the turbines authorized under the original general permit and does not apply if there was a lapse in permit coverage or if any turbines are added to the project. It does apply if the turbines change ownership. If a project adds turbines, the new turbines must meet the qualifications for a first-time general permit (§ 22.250(c)(1)) when renewing a general permit for a project. If there is a lapse in coverage, the project must qualify for a first-time general permit (§ 22.250(c)(1)) and may then renew (§ 22.250(c)(2)), if eligible, or apply for a specific permit.</P>
                    <P>The Service acknowledges that existing wind projects have less ability to adapt to the location-based nature of the general permit eligibility criteria (as defined in § 22.250(b)). After extensive review, the Service could not identify general permit eligibility criteria with which a project could self-certify that did not add extensive complexity or uncertainty. However, the Service retained the proposed eligibility criterion that any existing project that does not meet general permit eligibility criteria can submit an application for a specific permit (§ 22.200(b)) and request a letter of authorization to obtain a general permit (§ 22.250(c)). The Service will review all information provided in the application, including any site-specific, pre- or post-construction data. The Service will issue a letter of authorization to apply for a general permit if we determine that the take rates at the existing project are likely to be consistent with or lower than eagle take rates expected at similar-sized wind facilities that qualify for general permits. If an applicant receives a letter of authorization, we may refund the specific-permit application fee, but to cover the cost of review, we will not refund the administration fee. The letter of authorization may require additional avoidance, minimization, or compensatory mitigation requirements if appropriate (for example, when needed to ensure consistency with general permit take rates).</P>
                    <P>
                        The Service estimates that more than 80 percent of existing land-based wind turbines in the lower 48 States may be eligible for general permits. Wind projects in Alaska, Hawaii, island territories, and the offshore environment should apply for a specific permit if authorization for eagle incidental take is sought. Authorization for incidental take due to power line infrastructure is not included under a general permit for wind. The Service expects wind projects to avoid risk to eagles by ensuring 
                        <PRTPAGE P="9923"/>
                        power line infrastructure is avian-safe, either by design or use of covers. In the rare circumstance associated power line infrastructure poses an electrocution or collision risk to eagles, authorization under the power line regulation is most appropriate. Specific permits are available for wind projects that do not meet general permit eligibility criteria or request the customization of a specific permit. We have created multiple tiers within specific permits: Tier 1, Tier 2, and Tier 2 with reimbursable agreement. Changes to the fee structure associated with these tiers are described in the Changes to the Fees section below. Tier 1 specific permits are for low-complexity wind project applications (1) that can comply with general permit conditions or require only minor modifications, (2) where fatality estimates can be calculated with site-specific data collected to Service standards and submitted using the Service's information reporting template or where the applicant agrees to use the Service's generalized fatality estimation process (
                        <E T="03">i.e.,</E>
                         using the nationwide specific permit priors) for specific permits, (3) that agree to use a Service-approved conservation bank or in-lieu fee program to complete required compensatory mitigation, and (4) where the Service's decision can be categorically excluded under NEPA. The Service anticipates expediting Tier 1 specific permit application processing.
                    </P>
                    <P>Tier 2 specific permits are for moderately complex applications that (1) need modifications to general-permit conditions, including negotiated compensatory-mitigation requirements or (2) for which fatality estimation requires more evaluation of site-specific data, or (3) negotiation of other requirements. For the highest complexity applications, such as applications that require more extensive permit-condition negotiations, cannot be categorically excluded from additional procedural requirements of NEPA, or other unique circumstances, the Service will charge the Tier 2 fee and require applicants, including government agencies, to enter into a reimbursable agreement with the Service to offset additional Service costs associated with this added complexity and review time in excess of 275 hours.</P>
                    <P>The Service will no longer specify an authorized number of eagles that may be incidentally killed or injured on the face of general or specific permits. Permits will authorize the incidental take of eagles. This means that permittees will not be considered out of compliance for exceeding an authorized level of eagle take. General permittees, however, must remain in compliance with the discovered eagle provisions, which are different from estimated eagle take. However, to ensure consistency with our preservation standard, we will estimate the number of eagles taken for internal tracking and calculating compensatory mitigation requirements. The Service will track estimated take that has been authorized for bald eagles and golden eagles within each eagle management unit (EMU) and local area population (LAP). We will use the best-available information and tools in making these calculations, including compiling information on discovered eagle remains and injured eagles, applying statistical modeling to estimate eagle take that has been authorized under permits, and comparing estimated take and provided compensatory mitigation with EMU take limits and LAP thresholds.</P>
                    <P>
                        The Service received numerous comments regarding the Service-led monitoring in the proposed rule. The Service reexamined the potential of using operations and maintenance staff to conduct concurrent monitoring instead. Ultimately, we decided to reduce the requirement for general permits to concurrent monitoring because that will still provide the information the Service requires while resulting in a substantial cost savings to the regulated community compared to the proposed Service-led monitoring. The Service intends to publish monitoring standards for specific permits that will be designed to maximize flexibility to the regulated community so permittees can select the best fatality monitoring method for their project, while still giving the Service the information needed to ensure we are authorizing take consistent with our preservation standard. Monitoring must be conducted in accordance with permit conditions and, if available, Service guidance. The Service may use administration fees to validate concurrent monitoring methods and analyze concurrent monitoring data. Under specific permits, additional monitoring may be included in the permit conditions, such as for permittees wanting to reduce mitigation requirements by implementing experimental technology or post-construction monitoring. The Service will require only third-party monitoring when warranted (
                        <E T="03">e.g.,</E>
                         addressing compliance concerns or applying controversial approaches).
                    </P>
                    <P>Compensatory mitigation is required for general permits. General permits must obtain eagle credits from a Service-approved conservation bank or in-lieu fee program based on the hazardous volume of the project (§ 22.250(f)(7)(ii)). An eagle credit is the amount of compensatory mitigation needed to offset the take of an eagle. Service-approved in-lieu fee programs and conservation banks will be authorized for particular EMUs, consistent with the methodology approved by the Service. However, the Service will retain the right to direct funds from an EMU-scale to an LAP-scale, if the Service identifies concerns with a particular LAP.  </P>
                    <P>
                        Compensatory mitigation is also required for specific permits for wind energy. Applicants must include their expected method of compensatory mitigation in the permit application (§ 22.250(f)(7)(i)). The Service will derive the amount of compensatory mitigation required using a project-specific fatality estimate, based upon either site-specific data that meets the Service's data collection standards or the Service's generalized fatality estimation process (
                        <E T="03">i.e.,</E>
                         using the nationwide specific permit priors). These priors are probability distributions, created using information from a range of projects under Service review and others described with sufficient detail in Whitfield (2009), that describe exposure and collision probability in the Service's collision risk model before any site-specific information is taken into account. All compensatory mitigation for golden eagles must be performed at a 1.2:1 (mitigation:take) ratio. The Service expects Tier 1 specific permits to use a Service-approved conservation bank or in-lieu fee program to meet mitigation requirements. Tier 2 specific permit applications may use a Service-approved conservation bank or in-lieu fee program or submit a plan to the Service for implementing compensatory mitigation consistent with § 22.200 and Service-wide mitigation policies. To ensure consistency with the preservation standard, wind energy projects that are eligible for general permits but choose to obtain a specific permit will be required to meet or exceed the general permit mitigation requirements. Compensatory mitigation is not required for wind turbine infrastructure that is considered baseline. Baseline, as described in the 2016 PEIS, refers to infrastructure that existed and was operating in its current configuration and size prior to September 11, 2009.
                    </P>
                    <P>
                        The Service retains the maximum 30-year tenure for specific permits for wind projects. This tenure is appropriate given the amount of time that wind energy projects typically operate on the landscape. Specific permits may be requested and authorized for any duration (in 1-year increments) up to 30 
                        <PRTPAGE P="9924"/>
                        years. General permits for wind projects are valid for 5 years from the date of registration. Upon expiration of general permits, project applicants may reapply and obtain a new 5-year general permit. General permits for eagle take cannot be amended during each 5-year term.
                    </P>
                    <P>
                        For both general and specific permits, the Service will continue requiring implementation of all practicable avoidance and minimization measures to reduce the likelihood of take. These conditions would likely include reducing eagle attractants at a site (
                        <E T="03">e.g.,</E>
                         minimizing prey populations or perch locations), minimizing human-caused food sources at a site (
                        <E T="03">e.g.,</E>
                         roadkill, livestock), and implementing adaptive-management plans that modify facility operations at a site if certain circumstances occur, such as when a certain number of eagle mortalities are detected. General permit conditions will be nonnegotiable and fixed for the term of the permit. Renewed general permits will have the most current version of general permit conditions. Specific permit conditions will use the general permit conditions as a foundation but may be modified or added to as appropriate. The appropriate fee tier will be charged based on the amount of negotiation and modification required.
                    </P>
                    <P>
                        Permittees must train relevant employees to look for, recognize, and report eagle take as part of their regular duties. Permit conditions will specify a minimum frequency required (
                        <E T="03">e.g.,</E>
                         once every 3 months) and require that trained employees visually scan for injured eagles and eagle remains while in the vicinity of project infrastructure. Permit conditions will direct disposal (
                        <E T="03">e.g.,</E>
                         shipped to National Eagle Repository) and reporting (
                        <E T="03">e.g.,</E>
                         summary emailed to the Service) requirements and timelines.
                    </P>
                    <P>When three or four eagles of one species are discovered within the general permit tenure, we require additional conditions. If three eagles of one species are found, the permittee must notify the Service and implement an adaptive management plan. If a fourth eagle of that same species is found, these steps must be repeated, and the project would no longer qualify for future general permits. The discovered-eagles provision aids in identifying the rare project eligible for a general permit but experiencing more take than other projects covered by general permits. By requiring notification from projects operating under general permits if three and four eagles are found, we ensure that the overall take authorized by the general-permit program remains within the range we predict and is appropriately offset to the degree necessary for the preservation of each eagle species. It is important to note that found eagle remains at any project represent only the minimum number of eagles that may have been killed by a project. Depending on the probability of detection, which is determined by factors like site topography and vegetation, the number of eagles actually taken may be close to the number of eagles found, or the number actually taken could be substantially higher.</P>
                    <P>We will allow time for project proponents to adjust to these amended regulations. Project proponents who have submitted a permit application will have 6 months from the publication date of the final rule to choose whether to have their application reviewed and administered under all the provisions of the prior regulations, as amended in 2016, or all the provisions of the current regulations. Any application fees paid prior to the publication date of the final rule may be used to pay for application and administration fees required under the new regulations. However, the Service will not refund any application fees paid prior to the publication date of the final rule because the Service will have already undergone substantial processing of the application. Project proponents who hold a permit under the 2016 regulations may continue under that permit's conditions until the permit expires. Permittees that want to modify existing permits to comply with current regulations may contact their permitting office to determine if a substantive amendment request or a new application is most appropriate.</P>
                    <HD SOURCE="HD2">Eagle Incidental Take Permits for Power Lines</HD>
                    <P>Power line entities have expressed interest in obtaining authorization for eagle incidental take caused by powerline infrastructure; however, a number of barriers have limited participation in permitting. We create a general permit option for power line entities that can comply with standardized conditions. We also revise the specific permit process to provide as an option for power line entities that require more customization. The Service anticipates increased benefits to eagle populations as more power line entities obtain permits and implement required avoidance, minimization, and mitigation measures.</P>
                    <P>All power line entities are eligible for general permits. The Service recommends a general permit for any power line entity that can comply with standardized general permit conditions. Specific permits are available for power line entities that seek customized permit conditions. We have created multiple tiers within specific permits: Tier 1, Tier 2, and Tier 2 with reimbursable agreement. Tier 1 specific permits are for low-complexity applications that require minor modifications to the general-permit conditions and where the Service's decision can be categorically excluded under NEPA. The Service anticipates expediting Tier 1 application processing. Tier 2 specific permits are for moderately complex applications that can be categorically excluded from additional NEPA procedural requirements and need unique or substantive modifications to the general-permit conditions, such as negotiated compensatory mitigation requirements. In the rare circumstance a power line application exceeds 275 hours in review time, the Service will charge the Tier 2 fee and require applicants, including government agencies, to enter into a reimbursable agreement with the Service to offset additional Service costs associated with this added complexity and increased review time exceeding 275 hours. Exceeding 275 hours is expected only in rare cases; for example, if the Service's decision cannot be categorically excluded under NEPA or permit conditions require extensive negotiations.</P>
                    <P>The Service will not specify a number of eagles authorized on the face of general or specific permits. However, the Service will use annual reports submitted by permittees to estimate the number of eagles taken for internal tracking and to ensure consistency with our preservation standard. We will use the best-available information and tools in making these calculations. The monitoring required for general permits and most specific permits will be limited to concurrent monitoring by operations and maintenance personnel while onsite. Monitoring must be conducted in accordance with permit conditions and, if available, Service guidance. The Service may use administration fees to validate concurrent monitoring methods and analyze concurrent monitoring data. Specific permits may require concurrent monitoring or additional monitoring.</P>

                        For both general and specific permits, the Service will require implementation of all practicable avoidance and minimization measures to reduce the likelihood of take. To aid in assessing what measures are practicable to implement, the Service will refer to the Avian Power Line Interaction Committee (APLIC) suggested practices, including

                    <P>As part of general-permit conditions, the Service requires power line entities to develop four strategies: collision response, proactive retrofit, reactive retrofit, and shooting response, as defined in § 22.260(b). The Service encourages power line entities with an Avian Protection Plan (APP) to incorporate these strategies into the APP. However, power line entities may choose to include these four strategies as part of an APP or as stand-alone strategies.</P>

The Service expects risk-reduction strategies to be commensurate with future collision risk. For example, an entity would implement all practicable risk-reduction strategies for a power-line segment with repeat mortality events in a high-risk location but for power-line segments with rare or no known collision events, no action or continued monitoring may be appropriate.

                         describes how existing infrastructure will be converted to avian-safe (as defined in § 22.260(b)) within a set timeline (see § 22.260(b) and (d)). Investor-owned utilities must have a 50-year proactive retrofit strategy to convert poles in high-risk eagle areas to avian-safe; therefore, 10 percent of poles in high-risk eagle areas must be converted during each general-permit 5-year tenure (§ 22.260(d)(2)(i)). High-risk eagle areas occur where eagles are likely to be present and interact with power line infrastructure. Conversely, low-risk eagle areas occur where eagles are not present or unlikely to interact with power line infrastructure, such as urban areas. Applicants will be responsible for the assessment of high-risk eagle areas, based on this standard. Other utilities (publicly owned or cooperative) must have a 75-year proactive retrofit strategy to convert poles in high-risk eagle areas to avian-safe; therefore, 7 percent of poles in high-risk eagle areas must be converted during each permit tenure (§ 22.260(d)(2)(ii)). The Service uses the U.S. Energy Information Administration definitions for investor-owned, publicly owned, and cooperative utilities. The Service recognizes that this strategy may take more time than the other strategies to develop. As a condition of the general permit, general permittees that do not already have a proactive retrofit strategy will have 3 years from the effective date of this final rule to develop one.

A total of 13 poles or a half-mile segment of line must be retrofit. The typical pole selection is the pole that caused the electrocution and six poles in each direction. However, if retrofitting other poles in the circuit provides more benefit to eagles, those poles may be retrofitted by prioritizing the highest risk poles closest to the electrocution event. Poles outside of the circuit that caused the electrocution may be counted towards this retrofit requirement only if all poles in the circuit are already avian-safe. Converting poles to buried line is an avian-safe retrofit.
                    </P>
                    <P>To implement the above strategies, power line entities evaluate the electrocution or collision incident within 90 days and implement a response within 1 year of the incident. If extenuating circumstances occur in implementing the strategies, such as catastrophic weather, extensive fire, or other event that substantively disrupts power delivery, the power line entity must do the following: (1) Document and maintain records of the relevant circumstances, including why circumstances are extenuating and the plan to implement the delayed retrofits or collision reduction measures. (2) If implementation of delayed retrofits or collision reduction measures will extend past the expiration of the current general permit tenure and the permittee wants to renew the general permit, notify the Service at least 180 days prior to permit expiration. (3) If the general permit is renewed, any delayed retrofits or collision reduction measures must be implemented during the renewed general permit tenure. Otherwise, the permittee is no longer eligible for a general permit; however, the permittee may apply for a specific permit.</P>
                    <P>
                        <E T="03">Shooting response strategy</E>
                         describes the process the permittee follows when eagles are found killed or injured near power line infrastructure to identify if shooting is suspected, communicate with law enforcement, and identify and implement appropriate shooting-reduction strategies (see § 22.260(b) and § 22.260(d)). Power line entities are not responsible for law enforcement of nor liable for shooting events. At a minimum, power line entities must immediately contact the Service's Office of Law Enforcement if an eagle is found killed or injured near power line infrastructure and shooting is suspected. Where there are repeated shooting events, the power line entity should develop other strategies, including coordinating with the relevant land-management agency if the death or injury occurs on government property. The Service is working with APLIC and others to develop resources and suggested practices. It is generally assumed that eagle remains or injured eagles discovered in the vicinity of power line infrastructure are taken by that power line infrastructure, unless necropsy or other information proves otherwise.
                    </P>
                    <P>In addition to the above strategies, power line entities must also consider eagles in siting and design for new construction and rebuild projects and ensure that all poles constructed in high-risk areas are avian-safe, as practicable. This provision is not required if it would impact human health and safety, require overly burdensome engineering, or have significant adverse effects on biological, cultural, or historical resources. Permittees must also train onsite personnel to scan for and appropriately report discovered eagle remains. Under specific permits, additional monitoring may be required.</P>
                    <P>Compensatory mitigation is required for both general permits and specific permits. General permits must implement a proactive retrofit strategy (§ 22.260(d)(3)). Compensatory mitigation for specific permits will be determined for each application and included in permit conditions (§ 22.260(e)(2)). The Service will track take that has been authorized for bald eagles and golden eagles within each eagle management unit (EMU) and local area population (LAP).</P>
                    <P>
                        General permits for power line entities are valid for 5 years from the date of registration. Upon expiration of a general permit, a project applicant may reapply and obtain a new 5-year general permit. General permits cannot be amended during each 5-year term. The Service retains a maximum tenure of 30 years for specific permits for power line entities. The 30-year tenure is appropriate given the extended time power line infrastructure is expected to operate on the landscape. Specific permits may be requested and authorized for any duration (in 1-year increments) up to 30 years.

                    <HD SOURCE="HD2">Eagle Disturbance Take Permits</HD>
                    <P>More than two-thirds of the eagle-take permits the Service currently issues are for incidental disturbance by activities conducted near bald eagle nests. Incidental take by disturbance is different from incidental take resulting in injury or mortality. To reduce complexity and improve clarity, this final rule creates a new stand-alone regulatory section for the incidental take of bald eagles or golden eagles by disturbance (§ 22.280). This regulation revises portions of the previous disturbance-take regulation (50 CFR 22.80). The Service retains the existing definition of “disturb” (50 CFR 22.6) and clarifies further what does and does not constitute disturbance take (§ 22.280(b)).</P>
                    <P>The Service creates general permits for eagle incidental take by disturbance in § 22.280. The Service uses the standardized approach to permitting based on the 2007 Activity-Specific Guidelines of the National Bald Eagle Management Guidelines (hereinafter the “Guidelines”). Between publication of the Guidelines in 2007 and nationwide eagle-population surveys in 2018, we estimate that bald eagle populations have quadrupled in the Lower 48 United States (USFWS. 2021. Final Report: Bald Eagle Population Size: 2020 Update. December 2020. Division of Migratory Bird Management, Washington DC U.S.A.). This includes growth into environments that are developed or in the process of being developed, increasing the demand for permits for eagle disturbance. By creating general permits, the Service will better align the conservation value gained from permitting with ensuring the preservation of eagles. We estimate about 85 percent of projects that cause disturbance will qualify for general permits.</P>
                    <P>General permits are available for the disturbance of bald eagles when the disturbance will be a result of one or more of the following activities: building construction, linear infrastructure construction and maintenance, alteration of shorelines and water bodies, alteration of vegetation, motorized recreation, nonmotorized recreation, aircraft operation, prescribed burn operations, and loud intermittent noises. General permits cover conducting the activity, as well as pre-construction work, including geotechnical work. The Service did not include prescribed-burn operations in the proposed rule because, at the time, we considered such activities part of alteration of vegetation. However, after considering public comment on the issue and to ensure clarity for the regulated community, we included prescribed burning as a potential disturbance activity in the final regulation. Prescribed burning includes the footprint of the burn as well as where biproducts of the burn will be present, such as smoke, ash, or embers. Specific permits are available for disturbance to bald eagles from activities that are not eligible for general permits and any activity that may result in disturbance to golden eagles.</P>
                    <P>The Service specifies distances in the regulation within which these activities may cause disturbance. Activities occurring farther than the distances specified below do not require a permit because they are unlikely to cause disturbance. Regularly occurring activities that occur within these distances and pre-date an eagle pair's selection of a given nest site are assumed tolerated by the eagles, unlikely to cause disturbance, and do not require a permit.</P>
                    <P>Tribes communicated concern about the issuance of general permits for nest disturbance and nest take on lands of Tribal interest. In response, the Service has restricted eligibility, and general permits are not available for nest disturbance or nest take for nest structures located in Indian country, as defined in 18 U.S.C. 1151. The Service considers the case-by-case review of specific permits appropriate for nests located in Indian country. This restriction does not apply when the Tribal government is the applicant for the permit on their own land.</P>
                    <P>
                        Hazing—the use of nonlethal methods to disperse eagles away from a site—does not constitute eagle disturbance unless it is adjacent to an in-use nest and disrupts eagle breeding activity. The intent of hazing is to deter eagle depredation (
                        <E T="03">e.g.,</E>
                         substantial injury to wildlife or agriculture) or reduce threats to human or eagle health and safety by temporarily displacing individual eagles from a location. We currently recommend nest buffers of 660 feet for bald eagles and 1 mile for golden eagles.
                    </P>
                    <P>The Service also considers activities that are conducted adjacent to a communal roost or foraging area do not constitute eagle disturbance and do not require a permit. “Communal roost site” and “foraging area” are defined by regulation (50 CFR 22.6). Removal of a foraging area has greater potential to cause disturbance; therefore, we further clarify here that activities that completely prevent the use of a foraging area may cause disturbance. A proponent of a project likely to fully prevent the use of a foraging area should apply for a specific permit, particularly if the activity will remove all foraging opportunities within 1 mile of an in-use nest.</P>
                    <P>The Service will require monitoring eagles under general and specific disturbance-take permits. Monitoring will typically consist of collecting information sufficient to determine whether nestlings have fledged from the nest. Specific permits for disturbance may require monitoring as long as necessary to determine any impacts to the eagles for which take is authorized, including up to 3 years after permit tenure. The Service does not require compensatory mitigation for general permits. Compensatory mitigation may be required for specific permits to ensure the preservation of eagles. For example, any disturbance take of golden eagles that is not part of the Service's previously established 2009 baseline or disturbance take of bald eagles that exceeds the LAP authorized-take threshold and is otherwise unsustainable requires implementation of compensatory mitigation. Monitoring, and if required, compensatory-mitigation outcomes must be reported annually.</P>
                    <P>For both specific and general disturbance permits, we will require that applicants provide the coordinates of the nest(s) for which they are requesting disturbance authorization. Precise location information is necessary for both the Service staff who conduct eagle-population management and law enforcement. For disturbance take, we retain a 5-year tenure for specific permits and implement a 1-year tenure for general permits. These permits are renewable in the rare circumstance that an activity is likely to cause disturbance to eagles over a long period of time. In the rare event that the Service's decision to issue a disturbance specific permit cannot be categorically excluded under NEPA, a reimbursable agreement may be used to cover costs associated with the preparation of an environmental analysis and compliance with the procedural requirements of NEPA.</P>
                    <P>
                        For both specific and general permits, we require permit conditions that include implementation of measures to avoid and minimize, to the extent practicable, the risk that authorized activities may disturb eagles. To determine practicability, the Service will consider eagle-population status, the known efficacy of the measure, and the potential burden on the permittee. For specific permits, applicants will have the opportunity to provide input into these permit conditions. General-permit conditions will be standardized by activity type based on effective 
                        <PRTPAGE P="9927"/>
                        techniques that have been consistently and successfully used in specific permits for the past 10 years or more.
                    </P>
                    <P>The Service uses this rulemaking to clarify that the regulations for disturbance take of eagles will be used to authorize the incidental take of eagle nests. Incidental take of nests caused by activities includes actions that agitate or bother eagles to a degree that interferes with normal breeding and sheltering behavior. For example, prescribed burns may result in the disturbance of breeding eagles through smoke exposure and may disrupt breeding activity by unintentionally taking nests when a fire moves unexpectedly across break lines or into tree canopies. Authorization is provided only for incidental take of nests that occurs after application of all practicable avoidance and minimization measures. Incidental take authorization does not include take caused by lack of due diligence or negligence; for example, failure to identify nest locations prior to conducting an activity.</P>
                    <P>To date, incidental take of nests has been a rare issue and, therefore, is currently most appropriately addressed under specific permits. However, the Service will regularly review this issue with other implementation decisions. Applicants requesting incidental take of nests must demonstrate that incidental nest take cannot be practicably avoided. The Service does not anticipate authorizing the incidental take of nests for development activities. In the Service's experience, developers have sufficient knowledge of the landscape and control of their activity to make incidental nest take practicably avoidable during development.</P>
                    <HD SOURCE="HD2">Eagle Nest Take Permits</HD>
                    <P>The Service has revised the regulations for eagle nest take (§ 22.300). This final rule creates a general permit for the take of bald eagle nests in certain circumstances. We retain specific permits for the take of any golden eagle nest as well as for the take of bald eagle nests that is not eligible for a general permit. We also clarify that relocation or obstruction of a nest constitutes nest take.</P>
                    <P>We retain the four justifications for authorizing eagle nest take, which are emergency, health and safety, removal from human-engineered structures, and other purposes. We also add protection of species on the List of Endangered and Threatened Wildlife (§ 17.11) as a purpose for eagle nest take. General permits are limited to bald eagle nest take for the purposes of emergencies, protection of health and safety, and protection of human-engineered structures. In Alaska only, bald eagle nests may also be taken for other purposes. After more than 10 years of issuing permits to remove bald eagle nests, the Service has developed standard permit conditions that can be applied to authorizing the take of bald eagle nests using general permits for these purposes.</P>
                    <P>We will continue to require specific permits for any take of golden eagle nests because these situations have unique conditions that require site-specific permitting and because of the population status of golden eagles. We will also continue to require a specific permit for take of bald eagle nests under the “other purposes” in the lower 48 States because the Service must ensure that those permits provide a net benefit to eagles. The net-benefit determination depends on the circumstances of the purpose requiring nest take. In Alaska, general permits are appropriate because the Service has already developed and implemented standard conditions there and Alaska has a robust bald eagle population.</P>
                    <P>In this rulemaking, the Service adds a fifth justification for authorizing the take of eagle nests when necessary for the protection of species on the List of Endangered and Threatened Wildlife (§ 17.11) under the Endangered Species Act of 1973, as amended (16 U.S.C. 1531–1544). This activity would require a specific permit issued only to a Federal, State, or Tribal agency responsible for implementing actions for the protection of the species of concern. With expanding bald eagle populations, the Service anticipates an increase in situations where bald eagle management may be a necessary part of implementing recovery plans.</P>
                    <P>The Service will not require monitoring for general permits. After more than a decade of annual monitoring reports, we expect a 1-year permit tenure to better capture the necessary information to meet the preservation standard than requiring monitoring. In addition, a 1-year permit term without required monitoring is less burdensome to the applicant. Specific permits may require monitoring—for example, a permittee may need to monitor the area near where a nest was removed for one or more seasons to determine whether the affected eagles relocate and successfully fledge young. To be conservative, we will assume that each nest take authorized by the general permit will result in a loss of breeding productivity for one breeding season. We may change this practice in the future if data warrants a change in our assumption.</P>
                    <P>The Service will not require compensatory mitigation for nest-take general permits, unless it is for other purposes in Alaska where compensatory mitigation is required to achieve the associated net benefit. General permits for nest take are limited to bald eagle nests in situations that are typically hazardous to eagles or where eagles benefit from resolving the situation requiring the permit. Compensatory mitigation is also not generally warranted for nest-take general permits because of the improving population status of bald eagles. Compensatory mitigation may be required for specific permits. In determining compensatory mitigation, the Service will consider the purpose for the nest take, whether nest take reduces risk to eagles, and the population status of the species. A specific-permit applicant may meet this requirement by obtaining the Service-approved number of eagle credits from a Service-approved conservation bank or in-lieu fee program. The applicant may also propose other types of compensatory mitigation for Service approval.</P>
                    <P>For both specific and general nest take permits, we will require that applicants provide the coordinates of the nest(s) for which they are requesting take authorization. Precise location information is necessary for both the Service staff who conduct eagle-population management and law enforcement. The permit application may also require supporting documentation for certain types of requests (for example, an arborist report in the case of hazard-tree removal).</P>
                    <P>For nest take, we retain the 5-year limit for specific permits and implement a 1-year limit for general permits. These permits are renewable. The Service considered providing for a longer general-permit tenure; however, doing so would require that the Service require further monitoring from all general permittees that was inconsistent with the purpose of general permits. We have crafted these reduced tenure and permit-per-nest requirements to better ensure general permits for nest take are compatible with the preservation of eagles.</P>
                    <P>
                        Permit conditions will include the applicable regional-breeding-season start date. Additionally, the general permit will authorize the removal of a specific nest. General permits may authorize bald eagle nest removal from the nesting substrate at the location requested and the location of any subsequent nesting attempts by the eagle pair within one-half mile of the location requested for the duration of the permit if the subsequent nest re-
                        <PRTPAGE P="9928"/>
                        creates the emergency, safety, or functional hazard of the original nest. Take of an additional eagle nest more than one-half mile away requires an additional permit.
                    </P>
                    <HD SOURCE="HD2">Changes to Definitions and Procedures</HD>
                    <P>As part of this rulemaking, we have narrowed the definition of “eagle nest” to exclude nest structures on failed nesting substrate. Previously, we defined “eagle nest” to mean any assemblage of materials built, maintained, or used by bald eagles or golden eagles for the purpose of reproduction. We have added a qualification that it must be possible for eagles to reuse the nesting substrate for breeding purposes. Nesting substrate that, due to natural circumstances, is no longer and will never again be available to eagles for functional use will no longer meet the regulatory definition of an eagle nest. This definition of “eagle nest” does not allow for modification of alternate (unused) nest substrate to a degree that prevents future breeding activity. These activities will continue to constitute nest take.</P>
                    <P>We revise this definition to address uncommon but occasional instances in which eagle nests or nesting substrate are impacted by weather or other natural factors to such a degree that they become permanently unusable to eagles for reproductive purposes. For example, if a nest tree falls and the bald eagle nest retains its structure, the nest would no longer retain the official designation of an eagle nest as the substrate was substantively changed by the nest tree falling. A permit is not necessary for individuals and organizations to destroy and remove materials that formerly held the designation of an eagle nest but no longer meet the definition. However, individuals and organizations may not collect these materials nor possess them beyond what is necessary to dispose of the nest. Eggs, feathers, and other eagle parts are often naturally incorporated into nests with time. The Eagle Act prohibits possession, transportation, and sale of these items, either individually or in their incorporated state with former nesting materials, without Federal authorization.</P>
                    <P>
                        We also have revised the definition of “in-use nest” to clarify that the eggs referred to in the definition of in-use nest must be viable. As with our revision of the definition for “eagle nest,” this change ensures that our definition is more relevant to what is biologically important to eagles. Nonviable eggs may persist in a nest or even become incorporated into a nest's structure. However, by their nature, these eggs will not hatch. Under previous definitions, permittees have been prevented from removing what is otherwise an alternate nest because of the presence of nonviable eggs outside of breeding season. In implementing the revised definition, the Service presumes that eggs are viable unless the applicant provides evidence to document otherwise (
                        <E T="03">e.g.,</E>
                         absence of adults for several days, presence of eggs out of breeding season).
                    </P>
                    <P>For clarity, we add a definition of “general permit” to 50 CFR part 22 to distinguish general permits from the definition of “permit” in 50 CFR 10.12. We interpret the statutory language requiring a permit to be procured from the Service for take of bald eagles for any purpose to include general permits set forth in this document as well as the more typical individual or specific permits (see 16 U.S.C. 668a).</P>
                    <P>We clarify in the regulation pertaining to illegal activities (50 CFR 22.12) that obtaining an eagle permit of any type for a continuing activity does not in and of itself resolve take that occurred before issuance of the permit. This provision is currently in § 22.80(e)(8) but applies to all of the regulations in part 22 and is therefore better located in § 22.12. We also have updated the definition of “eagle management unit” and include a definition of “incidental take” to improve transparency to the public and general-permit applicants.</P>
                    <P>Along with this final rule, the Service will also implement the three following changes to our implementation of incidental-take permits for eagles. We will apply the baseline take for golden eagles established in the 2009 EA nationwide. Currently, baseline take for golden eagles is limited to only west of the 100th meridian. In the 2016 PEIS, the Service conservatively assumed that all authorized take of golden eagles east of the 100th meridian should require compensatory mitigation regardless of whether the authorized take was occurring prior to September 11, 2009, and was considered part of the baseline. However, recent information on the population status of golden eagles in the Eastern United States demonstrates that this conservative restriction is not necessary to ensure that take of golden eagles is compatible with the preservation standard, so we are eliminating this unnecessary restriction.</P>
                    <P>We will also update the number of bald eagles debited from EMU take limits and LAP thresholds when authorizing nest disturbance, based on new information. Before this change, the Service assumed a loss of productivity equivalent to 1.33 bald eagles per year for each authorized nest disturbance in the United States, except in the Southwest, where we assumed a loss of 0.95 bald eagles per year. Based on recent Service analysis of new information, we will update the nationwide debit from 1.33 to a value of 0.26 bald eagles per year. However, because of low sample sizes in our analysis, we are not updating the debit in the Southwest, which will remain at 0.95 bald eagles per year.</P>
                    <P>Finally, we will remove the 10 percent threshold for unauthorized mortality in a local area population (LAP) that was introduced with the 2016 rulemaking. We have since concluded that georeferenced data on unauthorized eagle mortalities are sparse and biased, making meaningful evaluation and application of unauthorized take at the LAP scale difficult or impossible.</P>
                    <HD SOURCE="HD2">Changes to Fees</HD>
                    <P>The Service charges application fees to cover the costs of administering regulations and permits. This includes paying for staff to: provide technical assistance and guide applicants through the permitting process, review application information, assess the biological impact and environmental effects of the proposed activity, and evaluate whether the applicant meets eligibility and issuance criteria. For specific permits, these actions are primarily conducted before permit issuance. For general permits, these actions will be conducted as part of an auditing process to ensure applicants are correctly interpreting eligibility criteria and complying with permit conditions and requirements. Fees are also used to pay for developing and maintaining an online permit-registration system and database.</P>
                    <P>
                        General-permit fees include an administration fee. In response to public comments, the Service adjusted the administration fee to reflect the elimination of the proposed Service-led monitoring. Instead, the administration fee will be used to maintain and ground-truth the permit program to ensure it is compatible with the preservation of eagles, including to: (1) better understand eagle population dynamics, including the risk to eagles from authorized activities; (2) better understand mitigation outcomes, including researching and validating avoidance, minimization, and compensatory mitigation measures; (3) address and improve various components of the eagle permitting program, including gathering and analyzing demographic data, GPS tagging and tracking eagles for programmatic monitoring, and researching and validating monitoring 
                        <PRTPAGE P="9929"/>
                        measures. Some portion of the administration fees may also be used, as necessary, to fund Service staff time to manage and implement the general permit administration fees. Specific-permit fees also include an administration fee. We will use the administration fee for specific permits for the same purpose as application fees—to fund staff for the administration of specific permits, including environmental review and support of the online permit system and database.
                    </P>
                    <P>
                        The permit fee and administration fee must be paid at the time of application. We consider permit renewals to be permit applications for fee purposes. General permits cannot be amended. However, specific permits may be amended during their tenure. There are three types of amendments. 
                        <E T="03">Administrative</E>
                         amendments are administrative changes, including name and address information. Consistent with § 13.11(d)(5), there is no fee charged for administrative amendments. 
                        <E T="03">Substantive</E>
                         amendments are those that pertain to the purpose and conditions of the permit. Consistent with § 13.11(d)(5), we will charge an amendment fee. The Service will charge an amendment fee and an administration fee for permittee-requested substantive amendments that require new analysis, such as modifications that result in re-estimating take, re-evaluating compensatory mitigation requirements, or requiring additional environmental review to comply with procedural requirements under NEPA (§ 22.200(e)).
                    </P>
                    <P>
                        For general permits, the Service adopts a scaled administration-fee structure to accommodate different sizes of projects. For power lines, general-permit administration fees are separated into Tier 1 for non-investor-owned and Tier 2 for investor-owned. The Service uses the U.S. Energy Information Administration's definition of investor-owned utilities as “large electric distributors that issue stock owned by shareholders” (
                        <E T="03">https://www.eia.gov/</E>
                        ). For wind energy, general-permit administration fees are separated into Tier 1 for distributed and community wind projects and Tier 2 for utility wind projects. We use the Service's Land-Based Wind Energy Guidelines definition of these terms (
                        <E T="03">https://www.fws.gov</E>
                        ). The Service may revise the interpretation of these terms in future rulemakings.

                        The Service retains the existing tiers of commercial and noncommercial for disturbance and nest-take permits. Applications are commercial, unless (1) an individual applies using section A of the application form for activities on that individual's privately owned property for individual purposes, or (2) a government or not-for-profit entity applies for take associated with public property using section B of the application form and includes documentation demonstrating its qualifying status (

                        For specific permits, the Service estimates a wide range of potential permit costs. Costs would vary based on factors like the complexity of the application or the required environmental review. To accommodate this wide range, the Service includes a tiered fee structure in § 13.11(d) and describes criteria for each tier in § 22.200(c)(2)(vii) and below. For incidental take, the Service will charge a Tier 1 application fee when specific-permit conditions require negligible modification from the standardized general-permit conditions, including the use of a Service-approved in-lieu fee program or conservation bank for compensatory mitigation. Tier 1 permits would require Service staff to review and evaluate the application and coordinate internally prior to permit issuance. We do not anticipate requiring additional environmental compliance review under NEPA for Tier 1 specific permits beyond documenting that the action is within the scope of the existing 2016 PEIS and the 2023 EA issued with this rulemaking. For wind energy or other applications that require a fatality estimate, Service estimation of expected take must require minimal data manipulation; for example, the applicant collects site-specific data according to Service standards or adopts the Service's generalized fatality estimate (
                        <E T="03">i.e.,</E>
                         using the nationwide specific permit priors).

                    <P>The Service will assess a Tier 2 fee for specific permits of moderate to high complexity that cannot or do not wish to meet the requirements for Tier 1. Because Tier 2 applications are more complex, more staff hours, including higher graded staff, are required to review application information, assess biological impacts and environmental effects of the proposed activity, and determine whether the application meets eligibility and issuance criteria. These projects may include more complex technical assistance, coordination with other programs or agencies, and documenting NEPA compliance. We estimate the amount of staff time to complete these tasks for moderately complex projects will be 250 to 275 hours per permit based on processing times for similarly complex permits issued by the Service.</P>
                    <P>We retain the provision in § 13.11(d)(2) that allows an applicant to request, and the Service to support, issuance of one consolidated permit when more than one type of permit is required for an activity and those permits are issued by the same office. When the Service supports consolidation, a single specific permit may authorize multiple activities, for example power lines with nest take or wind energy with power lines. The Service will develop guidance for consolidating permits. Because of the automated nature of general permits that have avoidance, minimization, and compensatory mitigation requirements developed for each activity, a project proponent would have to obtain the relevant individual general permits. Therefore, consolidating general permits is not allowed.</P>
                    <P>The Service expects specific-permit applicants to diligently pursue obtaining a permit after applying. We will consider a permit application abandoned or withdrawn if an applicant does not respond to requests for information or engage in good-faith negotiations. Once we consider an application abandoned or withdrawn, the applicant must submit a new application, including fees, to obtain take coverage for the activity.</P>
                    <P>Once effective, under this final rule the Service will not charge an application fee to government entities, consistent with other permits issued in accordance with § 13.11(d)(3); the Service will charge an administration fee to any Federal, Tribal, State, or local government agency for permits issued under part 22 subpart E. The Service may also require government agencies to enter into a reimbursable agreement. This fee is necessary to ensure the permitting program remains consistent with the preservation of eagles.</P>

To reduce confusion, we redesignate the current subpart C “Specific Eagle Permit Provisions” as “Eagle Possession Permit Provisions.” We create a new subpart E pertaining to “Take of Eagles for Other Interests.” This subpart now houses regulations that authorize permits for the taking of eagles for the protection of other interests in any particular locality.</P>

                        resource development and recovery operations from § 22.75 to subpart E, at § 22.325. We update the section heading as “Golden eagle nest take for resource recovery operations” to clarify that this regulation applies to resource development or recovery operations as authorized by 16 U.S.C. 668a. The purpose of this regulation is to authorize the removal of golden eagle nests that are physically in the way of resource recovery operations, such as on the cliff wall of a mine. We do not change the regulatory requirements that any take authorized must be compatible with the preservation of eagles (newly designated § 22.325(c)) and cannot be reasonably avoided (newly designated § 22.325(c)(1)). The take of nests in proximity to resource development and recovery operations to minimize the risk of disturbance, injury, or mortality to eagles is authorized under § 22.300. We also redesignate the current regulations at § 22.90 pertaining to permits for bald eagle take exempted under the Endangered Species Act to § 22.400 in subpart E.

                        To implement the general permits authorized under this rulemaking, the Service is developing an online general-permit registration system. After the effective date of this regulation, April 12, 2024, the Service will implement the general permit registration system in stages to ensure the technology is working appropriately. General permit registration for incidental take of eagles by wind energy projects and by power lines is anticipated to be available starting on May 6, 2024. General permit registration for disturbance of eagles and take of eagle nests is anticipated to be available starting on July 8, 2024. In the event these availability dates change, the Service will provide updated dates on

                         Those interested in applying for a wind energy or power line general permit between the effective date of the rule and the availability of the registration system may apply by: (1) completing application form 3–200–71, including sections B–D and the general permit questions in section E and (2) emailing the complete, signed form to

                         The Service will reply to the email with the general permit conditions. Entities must comply with and are authorized by the general permit conditions until the registration system is available. Once available, entities will have 10 business days to register for a general permit using the registration system, including paying fees. Failure to register, once available, voids the prior coverage granted through the above process.

In those cases, the proponent should apply for a specific permit and, if appropriate, the Service will conduct an intra-service section 7 consultation on its issuance of the eagle incidental take permit. That said, since eagle incidental take permits would authorize only the incidental take of eagles and not the underlying activity, except as it relates to implementing the conditions of the permit, the Service's issuance of an eagle incidental take permit would not serve as a nexus for ESA section 7 purposes for the underlying activity.

                         We are developing internal auditing procedures and external answers to frequently asked questions on audits. Limited desktop audits and onsite inspections will be conducted to determine if a project meets eligibility criteria and whether the permittee is complying with the regulations and permit conditions. In general, Service staff will conduct an audit following similar procedures to how staff currently review a permit application and administer permits. Audits may include reviewing application materials for completeness and general-permit eligibility. We will verify required reports were submitted and review the reports. Any required records, plans, or other documents will be requested of the permittee and reviewed. If there is a compliance concern, the applicant will be given the opportunity to submit additional information to address the concern. If, during an audit, the Service determines that the permittee is not eligible for a general permit or is out of compliance with general permit conditions, we will communicate to the permittee options for coming into compliance.
                    </P>
                    <P>The Service has estimated the number of audits that can be conducted each year based on the expected average time to conduct an audit and the fee money available to fund staff to conduct audits. Staff will conduct as many audits as possible with the available funds. There are many uncertainties right now as to how much staff time is needed to conduct an audit. We estimate approximately 1 percent of general permits will be audited each year. If we find general permittees are providing complete information, audits may go quickly and more projects can be audited. We will regularly assess the cost-per-audit and the percentage of projects audited to adjust the fee structure accordingly.</P>

                        whereas the role of permit conditions is to provide specificity on how those performance standards may be met by each permittee. Overly prescriptive regulations are difficult to keep current and can limit innovation. Instead, we will provide permit conditions and other documents to communicate the Service's recommendations on how to meet regulatory requirements. Avoidance and minimization requirements for general permits are based on the most commonly applied and effective measures learned by the Service from more than a decade of permitting. Eligibility criteria and the performance standards established in the regulation conditions can be revised through rulemaking. As information and technology change, the Service may update our recommendations and expectations on how eligibility criteria and conditions may be met.

                         The Service supports science and technology that increases safe eagle passage through wind energy facilities. There is no restriction on permittees implementing these technologies, which can be used to meet the performance standards of the regulation. However, the efficacy of these technologies and the details surrounding their implementation have not been sufficiently studied to warrant prescriptive requirements in these regulations at this time. The Service continues to stay abreast of scientific developments and may include these types of technologies in future rulemakings if evidence demonstrates their effectiveness. Specific permit applicants may request that the Service consider the permittee's use of emerging technologies when the Service estimates fatality.

                         We did not require perch discouragers as a minimization measure for power line general permits because the effectiveness is situation dependent. We encourage the use of perch deterrents where they may be effective. However, APLIC has moved away from broad implementation of perch discouragers because devices installed to prevent perching may provide a substrate to secure nest material, and, in some cases, may increase electrocution risk (APLIC 2023). Prather and Messmer (2010) tested several types of perch discouragers and found no difference in perching on poles with or without discouragers. However, we support the use of perch discouragers in situations where it is the best or only option for reducing electrocution of eagles.

                         The Service did not create “no go zones” because doing so is outside the scope of the Eagle Act. The Service's authority under the Eagle Act allows the regulation of incidental take of bald eagles and golden eagles. Our regulatory authority does not extend beyond that mandate to prohibit the installation of wind turbines or other infrastructure. The Eagle Act ensures the preservation of our two eagle species by protecting the survival and breeding productivity of individual birds but does not directly mandate protection of eagle habitat. Consequently, the Eagle Act does not give the Service authority to prohibit certain types of land use, including development. Instead, it allows us to influence certain types of land use to reduce the risk of take of bald eagles and golden eagles, including disturbance of breeding eagles, and to require avoidance, minimization, and compensatory mitigation from individuals and entities unable to avoid taking these species. These features of our regulatory process are common to both existing regulations and these new regulations.

The Service supports all actions that address climate change, including renewable energy development. The Service believes that this rule will help facilitate the development of renewable energy projects by revising the current permitting approach for eagle incidental take. The permit framework developed for renewable projects creates clear expectations for projects to achieve compliance, in some cases with no direct interaction with the Service (

While we intend the changes to the eagle-permit regulations to encourage more projects to apply for a permit, we expect that this rulemaking will have no impact on the number of future renewable energy projects on the landscape and, thus, no impact on the trajectory of climate change.

                         The Service is actively working on reviewing and approving other forms of mitigation and encourages potential mitigation providers to submit their proposals. As part of this rule, we created a new regulation specific to compensatory mitigation to more clearly signal requirements to the public. Quantifying the benefits of various compensatory mitigation measures and developing standards for their application in permitting is complex. To date, the Service has authorized power pole retrofits and lead abatement as compensatory mitigation measures. The Service is actively developing other compensatory mitigation methods, such as roadside carcass removal, that will decrease eagle mortality or increase eagle productivity. The Service encourages interested mitigation providers to contact the Service with ideas on compensatory mitigation methods. The Service agrees that it is important to develop compensatory mitigation methods that offset different sources of mortality and have a wider range of mitigation providers across the country. We will continue to engage stakeholders and develop additional guidance and standards for approving mitigation providers. This will include gathering information to address mitigation measure effectiveness and uncertainty and establishing appropriate assurances for the durability of mitigation measures.

                         The final rule retains the requirement to site compensatory mitigation within the same EMU where the take is authorized. Authorized take may affect individual eagles that are both resident and migratory. Banding records have demonstrated eagle movements within EMUs beyond individual LAPs. Thus, requiring that

Additionally, limiting compensatory mitigation options to the LAP scale is currently not practicable until there are sufficient mitigation providers capable of supporting every LAP. When compensatory mitigation is required by the Service to address an LAP concern, the regulation prioritizes implementing compensatory mitigation in the LAP where the impacts occurred.

                         The general-permit compensatory mitigation requirement includes a small portion for bald eagles. This is necessary to ensure that the general-permit program is consistent with the preservation standard established by the Eagle Act and implementing regulations. General permits do not provide for the project-specific review prior to issuance; therefore, possible LAP effects must be addressed after issuance. One tool is to require a small amount of compensatory mitigation from general permittees that the Service can direct to areas where LAP thresholds are at risk of being exceeded. The rate of this extra compensatory mitigation is based on bald eagle take predictions, but the mitigation amounts provided can be used for either species of eagle. If an applicant does not want to pay this extra mitigation cost, which the Service expects to be relatively small for each project, the applicant may apply for a specific permit where project-specific review would determine mitigation requirements.

                         The Service has numerous authorities that allow it to charge an entity permit fees and enter into reimbursable agreements. Funds collected through permit fees and reimbursable agreements are used to defer the cost of administering the permit program, including, but not limited to, salary and other staff-related costs and costs to ensure that issuance of permits is compatible with the preservation of eagles. Based on suggestions provided in public comments and as consistent with the use of collected fees, the Service will use these fees to fund analysis to: (1) better understand eagle population dynamics, including the risk to eagles from authorized activities; (2) better understand mitigation outcomes, including researching and validating avoidance, minimization, and compensatory mitigation measures; and (3) address and improve various components of the eagle permitting program, including gathering and analyzing demographic data, GPS tagging and tracking eagles for programmatic monitoring, and researching and validating monitoring measures. The Service does not have express statutory authority under the Eagle Act to require contribution into a conservation fund beyond these purposes, nor the specific authority to direct such funds if they were collected.

For power lines, general-permit administration fees are separated into Tier 1 for non-investor-owned utilities and Tier 2 for investor-owned utilities (using U.S. Energy Information Administration definitions). For wind energy, general-permit administration fees are separated into Tier 1 distributed and community scale and Tier 2 utility scale, using the Service's Land-Based Wind Energy Guidelines definitions. For specific permits, the Service created a tiered fee structure for wind energy and power line projects consisting of three tiers: Tier 1, Tier 2, and Tier 2 with reimbursable agreement, where a Tier 1 fee is charged for standard applications and a Tier 2 fee is charged for complex applications. A reimbursable agreement will be used when processing time exceeds 275 staff hours. The Service retains the current non-commercial and commercial tiering for disturbance and nest take permits.

                         Federal issuance of a permit does not supersede Tribal or State protections of a species. Tribes, States, and other Federal agencies are not required to authorize incidental take of bald eagles or golden eagles, even if a permittee has obtained a Service general or specific permit. It is the responsibility of the permittee to ensure they are in compliance with all applicable laws and regulations. To support the protection of local populations in this rulemaking, the Service has retained the existing preservation standard that requires the Service to determine that permits we issue are consistent with eagle preservation at the EMU and LAP scales. Under general permits, the Service will not analyze cumulative take at the LAP scale prior to general permit issuance. However, the Service will

                        review general permits issued and analyze cumulative take at the LAP scale if an area of concern is identified. States are encouraged to review the Service's issued permits and submit any information to the Service that might assist with assessing impacts to LAPs. If the Service is concerned about the status of any LAP, we can either (a) direct compensatory mitigation to areas of concern, or (b) suspend the general-permit program in whole or in part.

                         The purpose of this change is to address the increasing frequency of instances of bald eagle nest activity outside of the breeding season, including non-viable eggs in nests outside of breeding season and nests being maintained outside of breeding season. The Service agrees with the expressed difficulty of determining if an egg is viable in the field. Eggs should be assumed viable, unless evidence proves otherwise. Evidence like the absence of adults for several days or presence of eggs out of breeding season should be used to assess the likelihood of an egg being viable. We removed the protections for nests under construction or under maintenance for bald eagles. The previous definitions were part of a conservative approach for the recovering bald eagle that is no longer warranted. These changes are appropriate and improve consistency between the Eagle Act nest protections with the Migratory Bird Treaty Act nest protections.

                         The Service did reconsider Alternative 2 and again concludes it has a high risk of not meeting our preservation standard if implemented. Under Alternative 2, the regulations would be revised to include a general permit for land-based wind energy facilities only, with eligibility based on a project's distance from eagle nests and compensatory mitigation requirements in the form of a flat, per-project fee for mitigation. Adopting Alternative 2 is problematic because neither the Service nor project proponents know where all eagle nests on the landscape are located. This lack of data reduces our ability to reliably determine whether a specific wind project is eligible for a general permit. This situation also adds uncertainty for projects as well as to any assessment the Service might perform. Considering this, we expect Alternative 2 would come with the highest risk of inconsistency with our preservation standard compared to the other alternatives.
                    </P>
                    <P>The Service concludes that the general-permit program described under Alternatives 3 and 4 will best accomplish the dual goals of increasing participation and increasing conservation for eagles, where more than 80 percent of existing turbines on the landscape are eligible for general permits (and the associated benefits of those general permits) and where paths to a streamlined issuance of specific permits are described.</P>
                    <P>
                        The Service also concludes that Alternative 2's flat fee for mitigation and monitoring may disincentivize smaller projects (
                        <E T="03">e.g.,</E>
                         tens of turbines) from applying for take permits compared to larger projects (
                        <E T="03">e.g.,</E>
                         hundreds of turbines). The Service estimates that an average wind project qualifying for a general permit will pay $312,000 in compensatory mitigation under Alternative 2. This is nearly ten times the estimated compensatory mitigation cost of $37,200 for Alternatives 3 and 4. Although industry trends may be toward new construction of larger facilities and consolidated ownership, wind energy facilities are long lived (usually 30 years or more). Older facilities will continue to operate and must be considered when estimating participation in eagle incidental-take permitting and when considering financial impacts to permittees under Alternative 2 (Section 5.4.5.1 of the Environmental Assessment). Although risk to eagles from small facilities that are eligible for general permits may be relatively low, under Alternative 2, those businesses would be more susceptible to future enforcement actions and associated enforcement costs in the event of an eagle take if they remain unpermitted due to the relatively high cost of flat fees.

                         Because compensatory mitigation is provided either by the permittee or a third party, costs can vary widely. We acknowledge that the costs estimated for compensatory mitigation under all alternatives in the FEA are estimates and are likely to vary, perhaps substantially, across all permitted projects based on the mitigation method selected, the in-lieu fee program or conservation bank selected, and other details. These details are difficult to account for in an economic analysis, but we considered them as accurately as possible based on current data and our estimated projections. In the FEA, the Service estimates compensatory mitigation for an average wind energy general permit to be $37,200. These estimates are based solely on estimates of compensatory-mitigation costs using power pole retrofits, which are the only cost estimates the Service currently has available.

                         We updated the FEA to reflect our assumption that the proactive retrofit requirements associated with this rule are not expected to result in additional costs to power line entities. As stated in section 5.6.5 of the FEA, the Service assumes that power line entities most likely to apply for a permit are entities that have a risk of taking eagles and are already retrofitting power poles, thus already meeting this requirement.

If an applicant receives a letter of authorization, we may refund the specific permit application fee, but to cover the cost of review, we will not refund the administration fee. The letter of authorization may require additional avoidance, minimization, or compensatory mitigation requirements as needed to ensure consistency with general permit take rates.

                         The Service reviewed at length the possibility of automatically allowing general-permit eligibility for projects that overlap the boundaries between specific and general permit zones. This deviation from the proposed rule appears simple but comes with an increased risk that our general permit program would be inconsistent with the preservation standard established by the Eagle Act and implementing regulations. The risk is further increased because the projects that would be eligible for general permits by partially overlapping the general-permit zone would very likely create higher risk to eagles than other projects that fully encompass the general-permit zone. The Service must choose between addressing that risk by increasing the mitigation costs for all general permittees or retaining that all turbines must be in the general permit zone. Because of how substantive the increased mitigation costs were, the Service instead provides a mechanism for existing projects to request an eligibility determination case-by-case as described in a previous comment response.

                         The Service has developed and will implement a streamlined approach to specific permits. One approach we considered and adopted in the final rule was the creation of new tiers for reviewing specific-permit applications. The purpose of these tiers is to separate the specific-permit applications that are able to adopt standardized approaches from those which request more extensive review and negotiation. Applicants that are willing to accept standard specific-permit conditions (and do not require additional NEPA analysis) are eligible for a less expensive application fee and faster permit-review times.

                         The map published with the final rule uses eagle relative abundance as an index for potential risk. We use relative abundance data for eagles because the presence of more eagles in a given area at different times of the year results in more interactions between turbines and eagles and therefore increased risk of collisions. Thus, relative abundance data is an effective proxy for determining the risk of eagle take in a particular location. Although there are only two levels of risk depicted in this map, it does highlight areas that the Service has deemed to have relatively high or relatively uncertain risk to eagles. It is our intent that this map will be used by developers when siting wind-related infrastructure. As additional data become available, we will continue to refine our “risk maps.”

It is important to distinguish that the data products the Service is using are distinct from raw eBird data. We consider the products from the Cornell Lab of Ornithology to be currently the best available science for developing a nationwide approach to permitting. We recognize and acknowledge the uncertainties that are included with this method, such as areas where raw eBird data has limited reporting. However, the Cornell Lab of Ornithology eBird Status and Trends relative abundance products use machine learning to fill in these gaps based on the models' ability to relate the eBird observations to environmental predictors derived from global remote sensing data. For example, reliability of species distribution model predictions can be increased for unsampled locations and times by relating environmental predictors to observed occurrences or abundances. This approach allows us to predict abundance in places that may not be frequented as often (or at all) by eBird users.

                         This rule emphasizes general permits because that is the provision that is being introduced with this rulemaking. The Service has retained the specific permit approach and provisions. In this rulemaking, the Service has created general permits as an alternative approach to obtaining eagle take authorization for projects that meet eligibility criteria. The purpose of general permits is to simplify and expedite the permitting process for activities for which the Service has well-established avoidance and minimization measures and that have relatively consistent and low risk to eagles. The regulations are based on the well-established avoidance, minimization, and compensatory mitigation measures that the Service has been implementing as permit conditions for the past 14 years. This approach allows us to confidently authorize take consistent with the preservation standard established by the Eagle Act and implementing regulations without requiring Service review prior to issuance. We will continue to refine the general permit approach and incorporate public input on eligibility criteria for all general-permit categories included in this rule to ensure that general permits effectively simplify and expedite the permit process for eligible projects while meeting the preservation standard.

                         Many comments recommended that the Service allow project proponents to apply for a separate permit for bald and golden eagles, as opposed to requiring coverage for both species.

                         In reviewing comments, the Service realized we did not sufficiently explain in the proposed rule that the mitigation requirements are specific to that EMU and proportional to golden eagle abundance in the EMU. Commenters expressed concern that projects in the East, where golden eagle use of wind projects is seasonal and generally relatively low, would be paying to compensate for authorized golden eagle take in the West, where golden eagle use of wind projects can be relatively high. This is not the case. Projects in the Atlantic and Mississippi EMU have a lower golden eagle mitigation rate that is commensurate with the generally lower risk of golden eagle take in those EMUs. Similarly, projects in the Central and Pacific EMUs will be required to pay a higher compensatory mitigation rate for golden eagles, commensurate with the generally higher risk of golden eagle take there. There is a small amount of additional mitigation required in all EMUs, to provide funds if a LAP threshold is exceeded and mitigation is necessary for the program to remain consistent with our preservation standard. These details are covered in the Final Environmental Assessment associated with this rulemaking.
                    </P>
                    <P>Between the proposed and final rule, the Service again analyzed the possibility of authorizing general permits by species and did not select that approach at this time. While seemingly a straightforward request, separating the species introduces uncertainty, which increases the risk and complexity of general permits. To meet the preservation standard, the Service estimates general permit mitigation requirements based on enrollment and has no basis for predicting how many projects will opt for coverage of one species versus both. The Service would effectively need to develop separate general permits for each species, including corresponding eligibility thresholds, eligibility maps, mitigation costs, and perhaps monitoring standards. In the interest of keeping general permits easy to apply for and implement, the Service retained the requirement that all general permits authorize take of both eagle species. The Service will continue to review this approach in future rulemaking.</P>
                    <P>To illustrate the mitigation costs that will be required under general permits and how they differ across project sizes and across EMUs, consider two hypothetical projects: one with 30 and one with 100 project turbines, all turbines having a 95.7m rotor diameter. Both projects are eligible for a general permit and are located in the Atlantic/Mississippi EMU (where general permit mitigation rates for golden eagles are the lowest). We will also consider those same two projects as being eligible for general permits in the Pacific EMU (where general permit mitigation rates for golden eagles are the highest). The 30-turbine project in the Atlantic/Mississippi EMU would be required to mitigate for 0.20 golden eagles and 0.06 additional eagles (LAP mitigation), or 0.26 total eagles, every 5 years. That same project in the Pacific EMU would be required to mitigate for the take of 0.42 golden eagles and 0.06 additional eagles (LAP mitigation), or 0.48 total eagles, every 5 years. The 100-turbine project in the Atlantic/Mississippi EMU would be required to mitigate for 0.66 golden eagles and 0.20 additional eagles (LAP mitigation), or 0.86 total eagles every 5 years. That same 100-turbine project in the Pacific EMU would be required to mitigate for 1.40 golden eagles and 0.20 additional eagles (LAP mitigation), or 1.60 total eagles every 5 years.</P>
                    <P>These two hypothetical projects illustrate the relatively low cost of obtaining golden eagle take coverage for projects that are eligible for a general permit, and especially the lower cost for smaller projects and projects in the East, where golden eagle presence is seasonal and they are generally less abundant than in many parts of the West. We are hopeful that general permit applicants who think their risk to golden eagles is low will view this relatively low mitigation cost as worth the price of incidental take authorization for golden eagles, in the event such take should occur. If applicants wish to receive a permit for only one eagle species, they may apply for a specific permit.</P>

                         The Service recognizes the uncertainty that a potential suspension or termination causes. Suspension or termination of general permitting is an important aspect to allow the Service to respond quickly in the event of sudden changes in eagle populations at the LAP or EMU scale; however, it is not a step the Service would take lightly and without a notice and comment process.

                        Regulations currently allow for the revocation of a permit if “the population(s) of the wildlife or plant that is the subject of the permit declines to the extent that continuation of the 
                        <PRTPAGE P="9936"/>
                        permitted activity would be detrimental to maintenance or recovery of the affected population” (50 CFR 13.28(a)(5)). The Service will regularly evaluate whether the authorized take of bald eagles and golden eagles under general permits remains compatible with the preservation of eagles. If the Service finds that issuance of general permits in a particular LAP or EMU is not compatible with the preservation of bald eagles or golden eagles, we would first consider adding additional precautions to the permitting program through rulemaking. Rulemaking requires public review and comment periods. However, the Service is preserving, as a last resort, the option of suspending general permit issuance locally or nationally after publishing a notice in the

                         Public comment indicated that the Service's intent was not clear in the usage of the phrase “low effects.” We have modified the text to instead reference “low risk.” General permits simplify and expedite the permitting process for activities that have relatively consistent and low risk to eagles and well-established avoidance, minimization, and compensatory mitigation measures. For wind energy facilities, projects that have low risk will be determined by the relative abundance of eagles and the proximity of wind turbines to nest locations. For other general permits, the Service considers the implementation of the well-established avoidance and minimization measures to result in those projects being low risk to eagles.

                         The third-party monitoring requirement has proven impracticable or impossible to implement at some projects for a variety of factors, including health, safety, liability, and access issues for project sites that are leased from multiple private landowners. These factors have created a barrier to obtaining a permit. The Service reviewed the purpose of third-party monitoring and determined in most circumstances it is sufficient to rely on the requirement that the permittee must certify that the information submitted is complete and accurate to the best of their knowledge and belief, subject to criminal penalty for supplying false information. The Service concluded that the existing penalties for false reporting under eagle take permits will be enough to dissuade most permittees from intentionally providing inaccurate reports. We retain the ability to require third-party monitoring on a case-by-case basis for specific permits, particularly if we have ongoing compliance concerns.

                         The Service recognizes the tradeoff between spending money on monitoring or on compensatory mitigation. Monitoring can be expensive, and it may not be immediately clear how more monitoring benefits eagle preservation. The benefit of compensatory mitigation is more straightforward. While extensive monitoring has occurred at numerous wind projects, it remains difficult to draw programmatic, cross-project conclusions. Monitoring in a manner that allows for programmatic conclusions is critical to ensure implementing these new regulations will be compatible with eagle preservation.  
                    </P>
                    <P>However, based on public comment, the Service reviewed its proposed approach to monitoring. We determined that we can accomplish monitoring goals under general permits with concurrent fatality monitoring, which will be required under general permits, and without additional monitoring performed by or contracted by the Service. In the final rule, we require concurrent monitoring conducted according to Service protocols by project operations and maintenance staff, which will be sufficient to meet the Service's monitoring needs, provided there is sufficient participation in wind energy general permitting. We continue to require an administration fee, a portion of which will be used to validate the concurrent monitoring approach and analyze monitoring data.</P>

                         The purpose of 5-year review is to update take estimates and related compensatory mitigation for the subsequent 5-year period. It also provides the Service with an opportunity to amend the permit to reduce or eliminate conservation measures or other permit conditions that prove to be ineffective or unnecessary. The purpose of these reviews does not change with this rulemaking. However, the 5-year requirement has introduced unintended uncertainty which, according to public comment, has reduced participation in eagle take permitting under the 2016 regulations. It has also resulted in timing issues, where post-construction monitoring or other data is available off-cycle from the 5-year timing (

Instead, check-ins may now be initiated by the permittee or the Service in response to events that warrant review, for example, updating fatality estimates and associated compensatory mitigation requirements or revising permit conditions to reflect the best available science.

                         The Service uses the best available science in ensuring that general and specific permits are consistent with the preservation of eagles. The Service has conducted aerial surveys for both bald eagles and golden eagles relatively recently and consider these survey efforts adequate to estimate populations of both species within applicable parts of their range. The Service agrees that voluntary reporting of mortality data is unreliable. With this rulemaking, the Service improves voluntary reporting at wind projects in two ways. First, through increasing participation in permitting and prescribing the concurrent monitoring protocol all projects use, the Service expects improved quantity and quality of eagle fatality data at wind projects. Second, through the collection of an administration fee, the Service can direct funds as needed to ensure permitting is consistent with the preservation standard, including by

                         Unlike permits that authorize the incidental injury or death of eagles, monitoring required under nest take and nest disturbance permits is intended to detect breeding outcomes during current and subsequent nesting attempts and, if appropriate and practical, document if eagles breed again at their original or any new nesting location. The loss of breeding productivity constitutes take, as it prevents eagles from being added to the population. Monitoring requirements allow the Service to more accurately account for authorized take against our established species-specific take limits and, over time, may allow us to qualify or quantify the effectiveness of permit conditions.

                         By specifying distances in our bald eagle nest disturbance general permit, we are not suggesting that all activities within these distances must apply for a permit. Rather, we are setting a standard that only those activities listed within the final rule (§ 22.280(b)) within these distances can receive a general permit. This standard is intended to prevent project proponents applying for unnecessary permits for activities beyond these distances that are unlikely to disturb breeding bald eagles. Further, the specific and general permits for nest disturbance are not a prerequisite to carrying out activities or starting projects. Instead, they cover any disturbance that may result as an unintentional consequence of an activity. If an individual or entity assesses that their activities are unlikely to disturb breeding eagles, they do not need the Service's consent or concurrence to proceed, though they may be held liable if their activities do ultimately cause disturbance.

                        The Service acknowledges the growing body of evidence demonstrating that some portions of the bald eagle breeding population demonstrate increased tolerance to human activities. Our standards under the nest disturbance general permit reflect this consideration. We use the 330- and 660-foot distances for bald eagles because we are generally unconcerned with activities beyond these ranges, and we discourage proponents from applying for permits where best available science suggests they are unnecessary. Within those distances, project proponents may assess their relative risk to eagles (

                    <P>Regarding alternate nests, we agree that, by definition, activities at these nests cannot expose breeding eagles to sensory disturbance, as the eagles are not present. However, as the National Bald Eagle Management Guidelines (2007) note, alterations to the nest site and surrounding habitat may discourage eagles from breeding when encountered by eagles returning to that nest site. We will continue to update the National Bald Eagle Management Guidelines as well as develop similar guidelines for golden eagles.</P>

Most land-management activities, such as alteration of shorelines, alteration of vegetation, and prescribed burns, are eligible for general permits for eagle disturbance take. General permits for disturbance caused by agriculture, mining, and oil and gas operations are not available at this time. We have received permit requests for these activities infrequently, thus we have not yet developed standard avoidance and minimization measures. Operators of these and other activities may apply for specific permits. As we gain more information on the effects of these activities and identify effective avoidance and minimization measures, we may in future rulemakings add general-permit regulations for these and other activities.

                         Consistent with our current approach to permitting, a single permit for disturbance of bald eagle nests can authorize disturbance of a nest from multiple sources of disturbance of a single project or operation. For example, a general permit could authorize disturbance from land clearing, external construction, blasting, and operations and management activities associated with one project. The bald eagle nest disturbance permit is a “one permit, one nesting territory” system that simplifies our bald eagle population management tracking and reduces the amount of monitoring we require from permittees.

                         General permits are generally limited to three scenarios: emergency circumstances, health and human safety concerns, or nests on human-engineered structures. These situations, such as wildfire hazard and structural failure, often pose risks to both the nest and for people. In these situations, it is often imperative that the permit be issued as quickly as possible, as doing so often reduces the risk or effects to eagles. The Service also has been implementing permits for these activities since 2009 and has well-developed permit conditions with avoidance and minimization measures. The expedient processing and standardized approach make these permits a great fit for general permits.

                         Issuing one general permit for each nest allows the Service to efficiently track take. If the Service allowed coverage for an unspecified number of nests, the associated ad-hoc accounting of effects would make it much more difficult for the Service to ensure authorized take is consist with the preservation standard. Specific permits remain available for the take of multiple nests.

                         One commenter stated that the proposed regulation would no longer require the Service to make a finding of net benefit to eagles for nest take authorized under “other purposes.” The commenter interpreted the proposed rule to state that compensatory mitigation is required only when the take exceeds the limit of the applicable EMU.

                         Since 2009, the regulations require the finding of a net benefit to eagles for nest take authorized under “other purposes.” For all nest-take requests outside of Alaska, a specific permit is required for the purposes of the Service determining whether a net benefit will be achieved by the proposed action, or, if the activity does not provide the net benefit, the compensatory mitigation proposal. The net benefit to eagles is scaled to the effects of the nest removal. The Service did include a general permit for “other purposes” in Alaska because of the scaled effects of nest removal. In Alaska, well-established permit conditions provide sufficient avoidance, minimization, and compensatory mitigation scaled to the effects of nest removal, given the robust population status of the bald eagle and the available nesting habitat.

                         With expanding bald eagle populations, the Service foresees situations arising where the take of an eagle nest may be necessary for the recovery of threatened or endangered species. However, the Service acknowledges the tradeoffs are more complex with golden eagles. Because this is an emerging issue, a specific permit must be obtained for this type of activity. The Service added an additional precaution in that the Federal, State, or Tribal agency responsible for the species of concern must obtain the permit. The Service will assess the tradeoffs between the eagle species taken and the endangered or threatened species. The Service will consider the evidence that eagles are limiting the recovery of a threatened or endangered species and analyze whether the eagle nest removal will improve recovery for the threatened or endangered species in question. The Service will consider if issuing this permit, including required avoidance and minimization measures and compensatory mitigation, is consistent with our preservation standard at both the LAP and EMU scale. Finally, the Service will consider if other methods are feasible that have less effect on eagles but will still abate or prevent the problem. As a final protection for golden eagles, the Service may require compensatory mitigation for the take of golden eagle nests.

                         There are two aspects to this concern. The Service acknowledges the concern about staff intentionally underreporting their findings. Based on input the Service received, we predict this will be a rare circumstance and one that can be discovered and addressed with the assistance of the Office of Law Enforcement. With any permit, there will be good actors and bad actors, and the Service will address bad actors accordingly.

                    <P>
                        For the second aspect, the Service disagrees that concurrent monitoring will not provide useful information. Service analysis suggests that, on a large scale (

                         It is expected that wind energy project proponents will develop an adaptive management plan prior to or on obtaining a general permit. However, implementation of the adaptive management plan is required only if a certain number of fatalities are discovered at a wind energy facility. If three bald eagle injuries or mortalities, or three golden eagle injuries or mortalities, are discovered at a project during the 5-year general permit tenure, the permittee must provide the Service with an adaptive management plan and specify which avoidance and minimization measures the permittee will implement. If an injury or mortality of a fourth eagle of that species attributable to the project is discovered, the permittee must identify and implement the avoidance and minimization measures outlined in the adaptive management plan. Adaptive management plans may be revised during the permit tenure. A copy of adaptive management plan(s) may be requested by the Service at any time as part of an audit.

                         Circumstances outside the permittee's and the Service's control will continue to affect eagle populations. The permittee's responsibility is to comply with the requirements of their permit. The Service's responsibility is to ensure permits issued are consistent with the preservation of eagles, including at the EMU and LAP scales. If situations arise at the EMU and LAP scale that are detrimental to eagle populations, the Service may need to act to ensure preservation of eagles, which may include programmatic changes to permits or changes to a subset of permits. Generally, we will first attempt to address these issues modifying the requirements for or restricting new permits. However, consistent with 50 CFR 13.23(b), the Service reserves the right to amend any permit for just cause at any time during its term, upon written finding of necessity.

                    </P>
                    <P>1. To better align with standard industry terminology, the Service revised the term “electrocution-safe” to “avian-safe.”</P>
                    <P>2. The Service clarified that power line entities are required to ensure that all poles constructed in high-risk eagle areas are avian-safe, allowing the entity to determine those areas within the parameters provided by Service guidance.</P>
                    <P>
                        3. To address concerns regarding the siting of projects and buffer distances, we revised the conditions to read as follows: “For new construction and rebuild projects, reconstruction, or replacement projects, incorporate information on eagles into siting and design considerations. Minimize eagle risk by siting away from eagle use areas (
                        <E T="03">e.g.,</E>
                         nests and winter roosts), accounting for the risk to and population status of the species, unless this requirement would unduly impact human health and safety; require overly burdensome engineering; or have significant adverse effects on biological, cultural, or historical resources.”
                    </P>
                    <P>4. The Service modified the definition of “collision response strategy” to reflect that any risk-reduction strategies implemented post-collision should be commensurate with the collision risk. This may include no changes for one-off situations that are unlikely to reoccur. References to changes in engineering design have been removed and will instead be included in guidance.</P>
                    <P>5. Many companies were concerned that the proactive retrofit strategy would be infeasible to implement. Proactive retrofit strategies are important, as they serve as the compensatory mitigation requirement for power line entities. However, the Service also wants to ensure that requirements are feasible. The Service modified the requirement to a 50-year strategy for investor-owned utilities and a 75-year strategy for non-investor-owned utilities, with 5-year benchmarks. We also clarified that this requirement applies only to poles in high-risk eagle areas that are not avian-safe but may include other poles in the service area as well. The Service provides for delayed implementation to allow utilities to develop proactive retrofit strategies. The Service also provides for extenuating circumstances, such as catastrophic weather, wildfire, or other events that substantively disrupt power delivery, in implementing these strategies. Finally, we note that specific permits are available for any utility that is unable to implement the general permit requirements.</P>
                    <P>6. The Service amended the conditions associated with the reactive retrofit strategy to clarify that the evaluation of the incident must be completed within 90 days and the response implemented within 1 year of the incident.</P>
                    <P>7. The Service clarified that the minimum expectation for the eagle shooting response strategy is for utilities to notify the Office of Law Enforcement in the case of a confirmed or suspected shooting. However, we will work with industry to develop other common-sense response options.</P>

                         The fees and costs to applicants to participate in the permitting framework have been updated and are included in the FEA.

These tables comprise all fees and costs that a permittee is expected to accrue in applying for and complying with all permits. As stated in section 5.6.5 of the FEA, the Service assumes that power line entities most likely to apply for a permit are entities that have a risk of taking eagles and are already retrofitting power poles, thus already meeting this requirement. Therefore, the Service does not anticipate an added cost to power line entities for the retrofit requirement.

                         The Service will be implementing several approaches to improve efficiency in the specific permit process. One approach codified in this rulemaking is the creation of new tiers for reviewing specific permit applications. These tiers separate the specific permit applications that require extensive review and negotiation from those that do not, creating a streamlined approach and corresponding reduced application fee for projects that meet the new Tier-1 criteria.
                    </P>
                    <P>
                        In addition to creating a tiered approach allowing faster processing for Tier-1 specific permits, the Service will institute a procedural change to further expedite review of some projects. To date, 42 eagle incidental take permits have been issued to wind energy projects across the country. While all permit decisions were analyzed in an EA or, occasionally, an EIS, our experience with issuing these permits has led us to conclude that a categorical exclusion would be appropriate for most permit decisions because relevant environmental impacts for most decisions have already been analyzed in the 2016 PEIS and extraordinary circumstances are unlikely to apply, given the general impacts we disclosed in our NEPA analyses for previously analyzed decisions. Specific permit decisions we expect to categorically exclude from further NEPA analysis must, at a minimum, include the following criteria: (1) Estimated annual eagle take, after compensatory mitigation (if required), is below EMU take limits; (2) estimated annual eagle take, combined with other authorized take in the vicinity, does not exceed five percent of the project-specific Local Area Population; (3) permit conditions do not have the potential to cause effects on cultural resources or other historic properties protected by the National Historic Preservation Act; (4) permit issuance will not be precedent setting; (5) the permit decision and permit conditions will not be based on take estimates produced from new or unpublished methods or models; and (6) no other extraordinary circumstances that prevent application of the categorical exclusion exist. If the Service determines categorical exclusion is not appropriate, the Service 
                        <PRTPAGE P="9940"/>
                        will initiate an EA or EIS in accordance with NEPA. To ensure linear and efficient progress, substantive Service work on these documents will begin after the applicant and the Service have completed negotiations on the conditions of the permit.

                         Regarding opposition to general permits for nest take and nest disturbance, the Service notes that these permits are only for emergencies, for health and safety issues, or on human-engineered structures. In most cases, these situations are a risk to both eagles and humans. The qualifications for specific and general permits for nest disturbance and nest take are comparable to the standards established in 2016. Additionally, the conditions for our general permits will be based on the conditions the Service commonly requires in its current specific nest take and nest disturbance permits. While we are aiming to make applying easier for project proponents by simplifying the administrative process, we are not making permits easier to secure in the sense of relaxing requirements to protect eagles.
                    </P>
                    <P>The standards we are establishing around general permits for take and disturbance of bald eagle nests will assure continued preservation of this species for two reasons: First, because those standards are based on the knowledge and experience we have gained from issuing and monitoring hundreds of permits over nearly two decades, and second, a growing body of scientific literature has demonstrated that breeding bald eagles show a higher tolerance and resilience to disturbance and other impacts than previously thought. We do not have comparable data or experience in managing golden eagle nests and have therefore not opened the general-permit program up to removal or disturbance of golden-eagle nests in this rulemaking.</P>
                    <P>We acknowledge and appreciate Tribal concerns regarding the degree of oversight required for general permits when compared to specific permits. As part of this final rule, we have added a new eligibility restriction for nest-disturbance and nest-take activities in Indian country, as defined in 18 U.S.C. 1151, after recent consultation with Tribes. General permits will not be available for nest take or nest disturbance for nest structures located in Indian country, unless requested by the Tribe itself. Furthermore, the Service will make publicly available a list of all general permits issued, which Tribes can review. We will be implementing an audit program to ensure that those participating in our general permits are truly eligible and are complying with the permits' terms.

                         The Service has considered at length how to implement general permits for wind projects that are consistent with the regulatory preservation standard at the LAP scale. The Service will use all available information and the best available tools to estimate where authorized take rates may be the highest relative to our estimated eagle-population densities. Further, we will require Service-approved in-lieu fee programs to allocate a small amount of compensatory mitigation from each general permittee to be available to address LAP concerns. With these extra mitigation funds, in-lieu fee programs can deploy compensatory mitigation for eagles in areas where LAP thresholds are close to being exceeded (or have been exceeded). If, after expenditure of these funds, the Service still determines that general-permit issuance is not consistent with the preservation standard, we retain the right to amend, suspend, or revoke general permits in order to safeguard local eagle populations.

                         The Service calculated the take threshold for bald eagles and the take threshold for golden eagles to ensure general permitting is consistent with the preservation of both eagle species. The calculated threshold for each species ended up being four eagles. Ensuring take is compatible with eagle preservation primarily depends on the take rates for each eagle species, not the combined take rate of eagles in general. Therefore, there are separate take thresholds for each species, not a combined threshold for “eagles.” Finding four golden eagles creates a fatality estimate similar to what we would expect to see at an average-sized project in the specific-permit zone. Finding four bald eagles would produce a similar result. However, a project that discovers two dead bald eagles and two dead golden eagles during one permit term would be taking eagles at lower rates than expected under specific permits and, thus, a general permit is appropriate.
                    </P>
                    <P>
                        In response to comments that general permit take thresholds are not necessary for bald eagles, we reiterate that the goal of these thresholds is to ensure that the Service has appropriately accounted for the level of eagle take for projects 
                        <PRTPAGE P="9941"/>
                        receiving general permits in a way that is consistent with our preservation standard and ensure that projects with relatively high risk to eagles (of either species) are paired with the most appropriate management actions that are commensurate with higher or uncertain take rates. Exceeding the discovered eagles thresholds established by these regulations is not a violation of the permit. Rather, a project that discovers more than established thresholds indicates that there are potentially unique circumstances at the project site that would benefit from Service engagement through the specific permit process. The specific permit process allows for Service review of site-specific data and collaboration with the permit applicant on development of additional data collection and avoidance and minimization approaches appropriate for the project to ensure permit issuance criteria are met and that authorized take is consistent with our preservation standard, particularly at the local scale. This is not possible under an automated general permit process.
                    </P>
                    <P>In response to the comment that the general permit program is likely to fail, our analysis of take in the general permit zones suggests that it should be a rare wind project in the general permit zone that takes eagles at rates high enough to discover four or more bald eagles within a 5-year period. Our estimates for even large wind projects in the general permit zone are substantially lower than estimated bald eagle fatalities at a similar-sized project in the specific permit zone, on which the four-eagle threshold was based. Thus, we expect that only a small proportion of projects receiving general permits will exceed the bald eagle threshold.</P>

                         The Service received multiple comments regarding the use of Evidence of Absence software (Dalthrop et al. 2017) for specific permits; many of the comments requested that the Service eliminate the use of Evidence of Absence software as a compliance measure. Instead of Evidence of Absence software, one commenter suggested the Service should instead assess compliance based on the actual number of eagles found during fatality monitoring.

                        <E T="03">Response.</E>
                         The Service recognizes the limitations of Evidence of Absence software. Therefore, on specific permits the Service will authorize incidental take of bald eagles, golden eagles, or both but will not specify a take limit. The Service will continue to use the best available statistical programs to evaluate and estimate mortality rates. Currently Evidence of Absence software is the best estimator available to handle zero-inflated data (
                        <E T="03">i.e.,</E>
                         data that has an excess of zero counts). The Service will use estimated mortality rates to calculate compensatory mitigation requirements. The Service will also use estimated mortality rates to estimate the number of eagles authorized for internal tracking purposes. The Service will use estimated mortality rates for eagles instead of number of eagles found, as this approach is more appropriate for understanding how permit issuance effects eagle populations.

                         Multiple comments expressed disapproval of the Collision Risk Model (CRM), with some stating the lack of predictability with the CRM results in increased costs and timelines.

                         The Service recognizes that, as with all models, we must continue working to improve the CRM. However, the CRM represents the best science available today. The CRM was developed using site-specific and species-specific eagle exposure and eagle collision data provided from wind energy facilities across the Nation and represents the best available data to assess risk to eagles by turbines. The Service's CRM evaluates risk across projects in a consistent and predictable way while accounting and managing for uncertainty. The Service uses site-specific data to inform the CRM and have the estimate reflect risk for a given project while accounting for variability in both eagle use and collision risk. In the 2016 eagle rule and PEIS, the Service described the adaptive management framework for authorization of eagle take. At wind facilities, the Services uses monitoring data—consistent with methods outlined in the Land-Based Wind Energy Guidelines (
                        <E T="03">www.fws.gov/media/land-based-wind-energy-guidelines</E>
                        )—to inform the initial take authorization for a permit. We use monitoring data collected under the permit to update the estimates over time. Any mitigation paid by the permittee initially that exceeds updated take estimates is credited forward, reducing future mitigation burden.
                    </P>
                    <P>
                        The Service can evaluate alternative models as part of the adaptive management framework over time; however, to ensure consistency and adherence to management objectives, initial permit estimates are based on our peer-reviewed modeling framework. Monitoring can be designed, in coordination with the Service, to compare updates to the CRM modeling framework to results from other models. Any comparison would need to evaluate the model's ability to quantify uncertainty. Similarly, the Service's eagle permit biologists consider all site-specific data available when thinking about potential avoidance and minimization measures that may reduce risk at a given project, but rely on the CRM and consistent, representative monitoring data to represent risk across all permitted projects. Site-specific data (
                        <E T="03">e.g.,</E>
                         mortality monitoring) without use of a model designed to extrapolate beyond the monitoring period does not appropriately account for variability in eagle risk.

                    <P>
                        The Service will use the CRM to calculate eagle fatalities for internal tracking and calculating mitigation requirements for specific permits. While the Service generally does not recommend that project proponents propose an alternative CRM, under the new rule Tier 2 specific permittees with a reimbursable agreement may request consideration of an alternative CRM. The Service will review these requests on a case-by-case basis and anticipates requiring, at a minimum, publication of the alternative CRM in the 
                        <E T="04">Federal Register</E>

                         Wind energy general permits and specific permits will not have a take limit associated with them. Wind projects with a general permit cannot discover four or more bald eagles or four or more golden eagles within a 5-year permit term and remain eligible for another general permit in the future. We will continue to estimate take at wind projects for both general and specific permits to ensure consistency with the preservation standard and, for specific permits, determine required compensatory mitigation. For specific permits, the Service will require additional compensatory mitigation if it concludes (through data received in annual reporting or otherwise) that permitted take exceeds the level of compensatory mitigation already provided. If we determine that take at a permitted facility is not consistent with our preservation standard, we will conduct an administrative check-in and likely require amendments to the permit.

                    <P>Executive Order 14094 reaffirms the principles of E.O. 12866 and E.O 13563 and states that regulatory analysis should facilitate agency efforts to develop regulations that serve the public interest, advance statutory objectives, and are consistent with E.O. 12866, E.O. 13563, and the Presidential Memorandum of January 20, 2021 (Modernizing Regulatory Review). Regulatory analysis, as practicable and appropriate, shall recognize distributive impacts and equity, to the extent permitted by law. E.O. 13563 emphasizes further that regulations must be based on the best available science and that the rulemaking process must allow for public participation and an open exchange of ideas.

                        Costs and benefits of the rule can be broken down into three categories; impacts to permittees, impacts to the Service, and societal impacts. Impacts to permittees include permitting costs as described in Table 1, below, as well as other unquantifiable costs such as the costs associated with reading and understanding the rule, time spent on permit application, and costs associated with training staff on the requirements of the rule. Benefits to permittees include the ability to acquire a permit and eliminate the risk of enforcement associated with incidental eagle take. Where the costs of the proposed permit exceed the benefits associated with the risk of enforcement (
                        <E T="03">e.g.,</E>
                         projects with low risk of incidental eagle take or projects with perceived low risk of legal enforcement), we do not expect entities to apply for a permit. Impacts to the Service include costs associated with processing and auditing these permits; these costs are anticipated to be less than the benefits of anticipated reductions in staff time associated with processing these permits, as general permits can be issued without the need for Service interaction. Societal impacts include benefits associated with an anticipated increase in eagle populations associated with reduced incidental take and beneficial activities associated with compensatory mitigation requirements; no societal costs are assumed.

                        The maximum total estimated annual cost to industry for this rule is $16,821,500. The maximum total estimated cost over 5 years for all permits is $84,107,500. The average annual equivalent cost is $13,794,294 with a total net present value cost of $68,971,471 using a 7 percent discount rate. The average annual equivalent cost is $15,407,509 with a total net present value of $77,037,544 at a 3 percent discount rate. These discount rates represent a range of values that the Office of Management and Budget recommends as a Federal-program discount rate for benefit-cost analysis for most Federal programs. The above costs represent the total gross cost of the rule and do not reflect the costs associated with the existing regulations. This rule is expected to create an estimated maximum of $3,857,500 in new costs annually and $19,287,500 in new marginal costs over 5 years, as compared to the 2016 regulations. These estimates represent the maximum quantifiable costs; they do not represent other costs that may be incurred, such as the costs for entities to read and understand the rule, time spent on permit application, and costs associated with training staff on the requirements of the rule. However, these new marginal costs are more than offset by savings to both industry and the Service in terms of reduced Eagle Act enforcement costs and no requirements for preconstruction monitoring under general permits and the removed requirement for third-party monitoring under specific permits. The anticipated 74 wind-energy projects and 4 power-line entities that annually receive and comply with a permit will no longer be subject to potential enforcement under

                        the Eagle Act, which can result in substantial legal costs, nor will they incur costs to estimate and reduce their legal risks, which may include biological surveys and hiring staff and attorneys. While this total reduced enforcement cost is not quantifiable due to limited data, the Service expects that the savings exceed the total new costs associated with this rule. The costs of this rule are also offset by the ecosystem-services benefits associated with potential decreased take leading to increased populations of eagles.

                         as amended by the Small Business Regulatory Enforcement Fairness Act (SBREFA) of 1996 (Pub. L. 104–121, 201, 110 Stat. 847)), whenever an agency is required to publish a notice of rulemaking for any proposed or final rule, it must prepare and make available for public comment a regulatory flexibility analysis that describes the effect of the rule on small businesses, small organizations, and small government jurisdictions. However, no regulatory flexibility analysis is required if the head of an agency certifies the rule would not have a significant economic impact on a substantial number of small entities.  
                    </P>
                    <P>SBREFA amended the Regulatory Flexibility Act to require Federal agencies to provide the statement of the factual basis for certifying that a rule would not have a significant economic impact on a substantial number of small entities. Thus, for a regulatory flexibility analysis to be required, impacts must exceed a threshold for “significant impact” and a threshold for a “substantial number of small entities.” See 5 U.S.C. 605(b). We examined this rule's potential effects on small entities as required by the Regulatory Flexibility Act and certify that this action will not have a significant economic impact on a substantial number of small entities. This analysis first estimates the number of businesses potentially impacted and then estimates the economic impact of this rule.</P>
                    <P>To assess the effects of this rule on small entities, we focus on the proposed general and specific permit approach for incidental take by wind-energy facilities and electric-transmission companies.

                             We estimate that the number of nest disturbance and nest take permits will be similar to the number issued over the last 5 years: 677. The non-electric and wind power generation NAICS represent sectors that have historically requested permits. We evenly distributed the estimated total amount of disturbance and take permits across all sectors, with the exception of gold ore mining, for the 5-year period, which comes to 67 permits. Gold ore mining entities have historically applied for only 1 to 2 permits per year, or up to 10 over a 5-year period. We also assumed an evenly distributed number of permits across each year, 13, for the remainder of the sectors.

                        In the last 5 years (2017 through 2022), the Service has issued 26 permits to wind-energy generation facilities and 677 specific permits to other entities, which averages about 141 permits annually. For the 677 non-wind specific permits, most were issued to businesses and to government agencies, and the remaining were issued to individuals. The number of specific permits issued under this rule over the first 5 years may be higher or lower than the existing permit program under the 2016 regulations due to the creation of general permits and the remaining complexity associated with specific permits. General permits typically allow the regulated community to apply for and obtain a permit more easily, particularly when projects are designed at the outset to comply with general-permit eligibility criteria. Specific permits are available to wind-energy-project applicants that do not meet general-permit eligibility criteria. Based on these assumptions, we estimate that the number of specific permits under this rule will be similar to the number of existing permits over the last 5 years, which is close to 30 permits. Although small, noncommercial, wind-energy facilities (
                        <E T="03">e.g.,</E>
                         single-turbine facilities connected to public buildings) could apply for incidental take permits, we anticipate that most of the applications for wind-energy facilities will be for utility-scale projects. The largest expected impacts to small businesses under this rule would be an increase in the number of permits issued to wind-energy generation facilities due to the changes being made in the application requirements and the availability of general permits and the inclusion of general and specific permits tailored to power-line entities. We expect that this rule will impact 16 percent of wind-energy generation small businesses, with the expected costs of such permits described in tables 3 (general permits) and 4 (specific permits), and a breakdown of general permits by enterprise size category in table 5.
                    </P>
                    <P>Electric power distribution entities are eligible for both general and specific incidental take permits in the proposed regulation. However, based on the NAICS definitions, we assume that none of the potential electric power distribution permittees would be small businesses.</P>
                    <P>Businesses that apply for nest take and nest-disturbance permits typically include home construction, road construction, and various other construction projects. We assume that the number of nest take and nest disturbance permits will continue along this trend over the next 5 years. For this analysis, we evenly distributed those permits across industry sectors that best represent the NAICS industry sectors that applied for permits historically. We anticipate the number of permit applicants in those sectors would be relatively small, on the order of 1 to 13 per year for each sector, except gold ore mining, which historically applied for only 1 to 2 permits annually. As a result, this rule will impact less than 1 to 2.5 percent of small businesses in NAICS sectors 236115, 236116, 236117, 236118, 236210, 236220, 237310, 237990, 488210, and 212221. The cost per entity for nest take and nest disturbance permitting under this rule is minimal, totaling $100 per eagle or nest, per year. The minimal cost of these permits is not expected to result in a significant impact to small businesses in these sectors, regardless of the total percentage of small businesses impacted as a whole.</P>
                    <P>As described above, the wind-energy generation industry is the only industry for which specific and general permits could result in a significant impact on small businesses. Table 3 shows the expected difference between 5-year costs for specific permits and 5-year costs for general permits for wind-energy generation facilities. Wind-energy generation facilities will pay less for a general permit compared to the costs associated with a standard permit under the 2016 regulations. The permit application fee (including costs for auditing) is reduced from $36,000 to $1,000 for a general permit. In addition, applicants will pay an administration fee of either $2,500 (Tier 1) or $10,000 (Tier 2), as compared to the existing specific permit administration fee of $8,000. Compensatory mitigation costs for general permits for a wind-energy project will average $37,200. This is a significant decrease from the specific-permit cost under the 2016 regulations of $960,000 (using our calculation from the EA of $120,000 as the cost of an eagle credit). The average costs for monitoring for a wind-energy project will be negligible, a cost savings from the specific permit monitoring cost estimates of $1,100,000 under the 2016 regulations. The total estimated cost savings between a specific permit under the 2016 regulations and a general permit under this regulation is therefore slightly over $2,000,000 per permit (depending on whether the project is a Tier 1 or a Tier 2 project). The total number of estimated permits shows an estimated overall increase in industry costs associated with permitting under this rule, but only because the Service expects a substantial jump in participation across industry due to the improvements in the permit process and reduction in costs and time required per permit.</P>

                        Table 4 displays the new cost for specific permits under this rule compared to the cost for specific permits under the 2016 regulations. Under this rule, entities will pay $1,080,000 for compensatory mitigation, an increase of $120,000 from the $960,000 cost under the 2016 regulations. These costs have increased due to updates in the estimated amount of required mitigation for projects in the specific-permit category. The Service may issue three types of wind-energy specific permits under this rule. Tier 1 permits are for the simplest types of 
                        <PRTPAGE P="9947"/>
                        projects and would require a $10,000 permit-application cost. Tier 2 permits are similar to existing specific permits and require a $26,000 permit application cost. Tier 2 with reimbursable agreement permits require permittees to pay for staff time via a reimbursable agreement above and beyond the $26,000 permit application cost. For purposes of this analysis, we assume that the average specific permit will be a Tier 2 permit with the same permit-application cost as the specific-permit structure under the 2016 regulations. Entities will continue to pay their own monitoring costs estimated at $1,100,000 over the life of the permit. As a result, the total average cost increase to entities receiving a wind-energy specific permit under this rule is $112,000.

                    <P>Businesses in the “wind electric power generation industry” are defined as small if they have fewer than 250 employees. The 2017 SUSB Annual Data Tables report the annual payroll amounts by industry that fall within enterprise size categories. The data for “wind electric power generation” does not contain a range for businesses with under 250 employees; the closest reporting range is fewer than 500 employees. Table 5 shows a range of receipts by enterprise size and establishment count as well as the projected percentage of receipts impacted by this rule both at the individual establishments level and the total for that enterprise size. The wind-energy project general-permit cost will be paid in full at the time of the permit application; therefore, the 5-year cost of $48,200 is assessed in the first year. This cost would then be assessed again at the renewal of the permit in 5 years. Due to this being a one-time cost that covers a 5-year period, this amount equates to at most one percent of total annual receipts by enterprise size (table 5). As a result, this cost will not create a substantial impact on small businesses or specific industries. We base this determination on permit costs for general permits. The number of specific permits issued is expected to follow the same trend as under the 2016 regulations, and permits are likely to be issued in areas of higher risk to eagles to large, complex facilities that are well above the industry-standard payroll amount. Therefore, we do not expect any impacts to small businesses associated with these specific permits.</P>

                        While electric-power-distribution companies are currently eligible to apply for a specific permit, under this rule, these entities are eligible to apply for general permits. The permit application fee for these general permits is $1,000, and the administration fee is either $2,500 (for Tier 1 permittees) or $10,000 (for Tier 2 permittees). The costs for power-pole retrofits called for under the proactive retrofit strategy are estimated to be $0. Many larger utilities already have existing avian protection and retrofit strategies in place and would not incur new costs or benefits associated with the proposed retrofit strategy. For entities without an avian protection plan and a retrofit strategy in place, we expect that the retrofit requirement for a general permit will not create substantial new costs for those entities. Any costs associated with retrofitting power poles to be avian-safe (estimated from approximately $500–$2,500 per pole) would be at least partly recouped by increased reliability and a reduction in costs associated with eagle-

                        electrocution response. The Service assumes that the primary interest in permits in the first 5 years would be from firms with existing special-purpose-utility permits to salvage dead birds. These firms with known incidental take of eagles will benefit from a permit authorizing that take. No existing special-purpose-utility permit holder is a small business, and, therefore, there will not be a substantial impact to small businesses from this rule.
                    </P>
                    <P>A commercial business applying for a standard nest disturbance or nest take permit under the 2016 regulations would have to pay $500 per nest per year, while a noncommercial entity would pay $100 per nest per year. Under this rule, both commercial and noncommercial permittees would pay $100 per nest per year for a general permit. Businesses in the construction industry are defined as small if they have annual revenue less than $36.5 million. Depending on the type of permit applications submitted by an individual small business, the permit fees represent less than one percent of revenue. Thus, the creation of a general permit will not have a significant economic effect on a substantial number of small businesses in the construction sectors. The changes in general permit application fees are shown in tables 6 and 7. The costs of a specific permit for both nest disturbance and nest take would be unchanged from the existing regulation.</P>

                    <P>This rule is expected to create an overall savings due to reduced costs for general permits compared to specific permits under the 2016 regulations. This rule is expected to create additional savings to both industry and the Service in terms of reduced Eagle Act enforcement costs. Entities that receive and comply with a permit will no longer be subject to potential enforcement under the Eagle Act, which can result in substantial legal costs, nor will they incur costs to estimate and reduce their legal risks, which may include biological surveys and hiring staff and attorneys. While this total reduced enforcement cost is not quantifiable due to limited data, the Service expects that it exceeds the total of new costs associated with this rule.</P>

                        In sum, this rule impacts a substantial number of small businesses in NAICS sector 221115, “Wind Electric Power Generation”; however, the economic impacts to individual businesses are not significant. As described above, the number of businesses belonging to other industries impacted is not substantial and the magnitude of those economic impacts is not significant. Based on the available information analyzed above, we certify that this rule will not have a significant economic effect on a substantial number of small entities as defined under the Regulatory Flexibility Act (5 U.S.C. 601 
                        <E T="03">et seq.</E>
                        ). Therefore, a regulatory flexibility analysis is not required, and a small entity compliance guide is not required.

                    <P>The Bald and Golden Eagle Protection Act (Eagle Act; 16 U.S.C. 668–668d) prohibits take of bald eagles and golden eagles except pursuant to Federal regulations. The Eagle Act regulations at title 50, part 22 of the CFR define the “take” of an eagle to include the following broad range of actions: To “pursue, shoot, shoot at, poison, wound, kill, capture, trap, collect, destroy, molest, or disturb.” The Eagle Act allows the Secretary of the Interior to authorize certain otherwise prohibited activities through regulations. Service permit applications associated with eagles are each tailored to a specific activity based on the requirements for specific types of permits. We collect standard identifier information for all permits. The information that we collect on applications and reports is the minimum necessary for us to determine if the applicant meets/continues to meet issuance requirements for the particular activity. Standardizing general information common to the application forms makes filing of applications easier for the public as well as expedites our review of applications.

                        —The Service removed the regulatory requirement for specific permits to mandate an administrative check-in with the Service at least every 5 years during the permit tenure. The Service introduced these mandatory 5-year permit reviews as part of the 2016 Eagle Rule to ensure that the Service had an opportunity to ask for and review all existing data related to a long-term activity's impacts on eagles. The purpose of 5-year review is to update take estimates and related compensatory mitigation for the subsequent 5-year period. It also provides the Service with an opportunity to amend the permit to reduce or eliminate conservation measures or other permit conditions that prove to be ineffective or unnecessary. The purpose of these reviews does not change with this rulemaking. However, the 5-year requirement has introduced unintended uncertainty which, according to public comment, has reduced participation in eagle take permitting under the 2016 regulations. It has also resulted in timing issues, where post-construction monitoring or other data is available off-cycle from the 5-year timing (
                        <E T="03">e.g.,</E>
                         year 3 or 4) but cannot be used until the scheduled check-in. Instead, check-ins may now be initiated by the permittee or the Service in response to events that warrant review, for example, updating fatality estimates and associated compensatory mitigation requirements or revising permit conditions to reflect the best available science.

Audits may include reviewing application materials for completeness and general permit eligibility. Any required records, plans, or other documents will be requested of the permittee and reviewed. If there is a compliance concern, the applicant will be given the opportunity to submit additional information to address the concern. If, during an audit, the Service determines that the permittee is not eligible for a general permit or is out of compliance with general permit conditions, we will communicate to the permittee options for coming into compliance.

                        —Any permit authorizing take that would exceed the applicable EMU take limit will require compensatory mitigation, except in circumstances where the action is considered in the best interest of an eagle. Compensatory mitigation for this purpose must ensure the preservation of the affected eagle species by mitigating an amount equal to or greater than the authorized or expected take. Compensatory mitigation must either reduce another ongoing form of mortality or increase the eagle population of the affected species. Compensatory mitigation for golden eagles must be performed at a 1.2:1 (mitigation: take) ratio. A permit may require compensatory mitigation when the Service determines, according to the best available information, that the take authorized by the permitted activity is not consistent with maintaining the persistence of the local area population of an eagle species.

                        The Service must approve types of compensatory mitigation and may include conservation banks, in-lieu fee programs, or permittee-responsible mitigation as mitigation providers. General permittees meet this requirement by obtaining required credits from a Service-approved, third-party mitigation provider. Specific permittees can meet this requirement by obtaining required credits from a Service-approved, third-party mitigation provider or meeting the requirements to be a permittee-responsible mitigation provider as described in 50 CFR 22.220(c)(2). Third-party mitigation providers, such as in-lieu fee programs

                    <P>To obtain approval as a mitigation provider, potential providers must submit a mitigation plan to the Service that demonstrates how the standards in 50 CFR 22.220(b) will be met. At a minimum, this must include a description of the mitigation, the benefit to eagles, the locations where projects will be implemented, the EMU and local area population affected, the number of credits provided, and an explanation of the rationale for the number of eagle credits provided. The Service must approve the mitigation plan prior to implementation.</P>

We do not require monitoring for intentional take, including when Native American Tribes take an eagle as part of a religious ceremony or when falconers trap golden eagles that are depredating on livestock. A fundamental purpose of monitoring under eagle take permits is to track levels of take for population management. For disturbance permits, monitoring also provides information about whether the permitted activity actually disturbed eagles, allowing the Service to better understand when these types of permits may not be needed.

                        We evaluated the environmental impacts of the changes to the regulations and completed an environmental assessment and finding of no significant impact. The FONSI is the final step in the NEPA process for this eagle rule revision process. The FONSI and final environmental assessment are available in Docket No. FWS–HQ–MB–2020–0023 (available at 
                        <E T="03">https://www.regulations.gov</E>

                        Section 7 of the Endangered Species Act of 1973, as amended (16 U.S.C. 1531–43), requires Federal agencies to “ensure that any action authorized, funded, or carried out . . . is not likely to jeopardize the continued existence of any endangered species or threatened species or result in the destruction or adverse modification of [critical] habitat” (16 U.S.C. 1536(a)(2)). Intra-Service consultations and conferences consider the effects of the Service's actions on listed species, species proposed for listing, and candidate species. Our final action of issuing our regulations regarding take of non-ESA-listed eagles does not authorize, fund, or carry out any activity that may affect—directly or indirectly—any ESA-listed species or their critical habitat. 
                        <E T="03">See, e.g., Sierra Club</E>

                        <PRTPAGE P="9956"/>
                        the Eagle Act does not empower us to authorize, fund, or carry out project activities by third parties. The Eagle Act empowers us to authorize take of bald and golden eagles. Thus, we have determined these revisions have no effect on any listed species, species proposed for listing, or candidate species or their critical habitat. As a result, section 7 consultation is not required on this rulemaking action. As appropriate, we will conduct project-specific, intra-Service section 7 consultations in the future if our proposed act of issuing a permit for take of eagles may affect ESA-listed species or critical habitat.

                    <HD SOURCE="HD2">Government-to-Government Relationship With Tribes</HD>
                    <P>In accordance with the President's memorandum of April 29, 1994, “Government-to-Government Relations with Native American Tribal Governments” (59 FR 22951), E.O. 13175, and the Department of the Interior's manual at 512 DM 2, we readily acknowledge our responsibility to communicate meaningfully with recognized Federal Tribes on a government-to-government basis. In accordance with Secretary's Order 3206 of June 5, 1997 (American Indian Tribal Rights, Federal-Tribal Trust Responsibilities, and the Endangered Species Act), we readily acknowledge our responsibilities to work directly with Tribes in developing programs for healthy ecosystems, to acknowledge that Tribal lands are not subject to the same controls as Federal public lands, to remain sensitive to Indian culture, and to make information available to Tribes. Although we do not consider this rulemaking as having Tribal implications according to E.O. 13175 because it is not likely to have “substantial direct effects” on any particular Tribe, we conducted Tribal outreach and invited government-to-government consultation as if it does.</P>
                    <P>The Service provided written notification to Tribes about the ANPR and the proposed rule and offered government-to-government consultation. The Service conducted Tribal informational webinars on October 14 and 21, 2021, during the ANPR public comment period as well as prior to publication of the proposed rule. Seven Tribal representatives provided written comments. The Service conducted two additional Tribal informational webinars on October 19 and November 2, 2022, during the proposed rule public comment period as well as bilateral information sessions when requested by Tribes. Tribal consulation was requested by one Tribe, which was conducted in September 2023. No other Tribes requested consultation with the Service. The Service conducted a final Tribal informational webinar on December 12, 2023, regarding the changes the Service made in developing the final rule. Eleven Tribal representatives provided written comments. As described earlier in this preamble, we have revised the proposed regulations in response to these comments.</P>
                    <P>The Service acknowledges our Federal Tribal trust responsibilities and deeply honors our sovereign nation-to-nation relationship with Tribes. Throughout all phases of the rulemaking process, the Service has encouraged and welcomed Tribal engagement, including government-to-government consultation. To date, we have conducted one government-to-government consultation. We invite further bilateral government-to-government consultation at any time.</P>

                    <P>E.O. 13211 requires agencies to prepare statements of energy effects when undertaking certain actions. This rule is a significant regulatory action under E.O. 12866; however, it will not significantly affect energy supplies, distribution, or use. The permitting process streamlines permitting for wind energy and power distribution; therefore, the rule is intended to ease any administrative burden on energy development and will not impact it negatively. Therefore, this action is not a significant energy action, and no statement of energy effects is required.</P>

                                 Specific permits authorize the take of bald eagles or golden eagles for other interests by activities that are described in the regulations in this subpart. Proponents of projects may apply for a specific permit if they do not meet eligibility criteria for general permits described in—or are conducting an activity not identified in—§ 22.250, § 22.260, § 22.280, or § 22.300. Specific permits may be recommended by the Service or requested by entities that are eligible for but do not want to obtain a general permit.
                            </P>
                            <P>

                                <E T="03">Eligibility.</E>
                                 To qualify for a specific permit, you must be conducting an activity identified in § 22.250, § 22.260, § 22.280, or § 22.300. You must also meet any eligibility requirements identified in the relevant section.
                            </P>
                            <P>(1) Permits are issued to the individual or entity conducting the activity, such as the owner or manager of the entity conducting the activity. The applicant is responsible for compliance with the permit and must have the authority to implement the required permit conditions.</P>
                            <P>(2) Contractors or consultants may assist in completing applications or conducting work as a subpermittee but may not be a permit holder.</P>
                            <P>(3) Applicants may not break down a project into small parts to minimize the activity.</P>
                            <P>(4) Applicants may not combine projects if the activities are not readily identifiable as being part of the same project. If you want to obtain a consolidated permit for multiple activities, you must first submit a separate application for each project and request the Service determine if it is appropriate to consolidate permits.</P>
                            <P>(5) Specific permits are issued to a single permit holder. If multiple entities operate a joint project and want to obtain joint authorization, the application must designate one entity as the permit holder and that entity must accept the legal liability for the other entities. The other entities must grant sufficient authority to the permit holder to carry out any activities required under the permit.</P>
                            <P>(6) Upon receipt of your application for a specific permit, the Service may direct you to apply for a general permit or determine that a permit is not required. The Service will provide a letter of authorization to keep in your records.</P>
                            <P>(7) For existing wind energy projects only, projects that are not eligible for a general permit for incidental take of eagles (§ 22.250) may request a Letter of Authorization from the Service to apply for a general permit. The Service will review and determine if eagle risk at the project is consistent with the risk expected for general permits. To request review, you must submit a specific permit application and request a determination for general permit eligibility. Your administration fee will not be refunded to cover the cost of conducting this review. The application fee may be refunded (50 CFR 13.11(d)(1)).</P>

If the Service has officially issued or endorsed survey, modeling, take-estimation, or other standards for the activity that will take eagles, you must follow them and include in your application all the information thereby obtained, unless the Service waives this requirement for your application.</P>
                            <P>(iv) Implemented and proposed steps to avoid and minimize to the maximum degree practicable, compensate for, and monitor impacts on eagles.</P>
                            <P>(v) Alternative actions considered and the reasons why those alternatives are not practicable.</P>
                            <P>(vi) Any supplemental information necessary for the Service to make an adequate determination on the application (see § 13.21 of this subchapter).</P>
                            <P>(vii) Payment of the required application and administration fees (see § 13.11(d)(4) of this subchapter) for the appropriate fee tier, and, if required, proposed compensatory mitigation plan or eagle credits to be obtained from a Service-approved conservation bank or in-lieu fee program. All compensatory mitigation must comply with the provisions of § 22.220. For incidental take permits issued under §§ 22.250 and 22.260:</P>
                            <P>(A) The Tier 1 application fee is assessed when standardized permit conditions require negligible modifications, additional environmental compliance review is not required, and, if required, fatality estimates require minimal data manipulation.</P>
                            <P>(B) The Tier 2 application fee is assessed for all other specific permit incidental take applications that require 275 staff-hours or fewer for review, including compliance with the procedural requirements of NEPA. The Service may require applicants to enter into a reimbursable agreement to cover the costs above 275 staff-hours.</P>
                            <P>

                                <E T="03">Issuance criteria.</E>
                                 Upon receiving a complete application, the Regional Director will decide whether to issue a permit based on the general criteria of § 13.21 of this subchapter and whether the application meets the following requirements:
                            </P>
                            <P>(1) The applicant is eligible for a specific permit.</P>
                            <P>(2) The take:</P>
                            <P>(i) Is necessary to protect a legitimate interest in a particular locality;</P>
                            <P>(ii) Results from, but is not the purpose of, the activity; and</P>
                            <P>(iii) Cannot practicably be avoided.</P>
                            <P>(3) The amount of take the Service authorizes under the permit is compatible with the preservation of the bald eagle and the golden eagle, including consideration of the effects of other permitted take and other factors affecting bald eagle and golden eagle populations.  </P>
                            <P>(4) The applicant has proposed avoidance and minimization measures to reduce the take to the maximum degree practicable relative to the magnitude of the activity's impacts on eagles. These measures must meet or exceed the requirements of the general permit regulation (§ 22.210), except where not practicable.</P>
                            <P>(5) If compensatory mitigation is required, the applicant has proposed either to implement compensatory mitigation measures that comply with the standards in § 22.220 or secure required eagle credits from a Service-approved conservation bank or in-lieu fee program. Compensatory mitigation must meet or exceed the requirements of the general permit regulation (§ 22.210), except when the Service's evaluation of site-specific data indicates a lower mitigation rate is appropriate.</P>
                            <P>(6) The applicant has proposed monitoring plans that are sufficient to determine the effects on eagle(s) of the proposed activity.</P>
                            <P>(7) The proposed reporting is sufficient for the Service to determine the effects on eagle(s).</P>
                            <P>(8) Any additional factors that may be relevant to our decision whether to issue the permit, including, but not limited to, the cultural significance of a local eagle population and whether issuance of a permit would preclude the Service from authorizing take necessary to protect an interest of higher priority. The Service will prioritize safety emergencies, Native American Tribal religious use, and public health and safety.</P>
                            <P>
                                (e) 
                                <E T="03">Modifications to your permit.</E>
                                 If the permittee requests substantive amendments (see § 13.11(d)(5) of this subchapter) during the permit tenure, the Service will charge an amendment fee. The Service will charge an amendment fee and an administration fee for permittee-requested substantive amendments that require new analysis, such as modifications that result in re-estimating take, re-evaluating compensatory mitigation requirements, or requiring additional environmental review to comply with procedural requirements under NEPA.
                            </P>
                            <P>

                                <E T="03">Tenure.</E>
                                 The tenure of each permit will be designated on the face of the permit. Specific permits may be valid for a maximum of 30 years. Permit tenure may be less, as restricted by the provisions for specific activities set forth in § 22.250, § 22.260, § 22.280, or § 22.300 or as appropriate to the duration and nature of the proposed activity, including mitigation requirements.

                                <E T="03">Eligibility.</E>
                                 To qualify for a general permit, you must be conducting an activity identified in § 22.250, § 22.260, § 22.280, or § 22.300 and meet any additional eligibility requirements identified in the relevant section.
                            </P>
                            <P>(1) Permits are issued to the individual or entity conducting the activity, such as the owner or manager of the entity conducting the activity. The applicant is responsible for compliance with the permit and must have the authority to implement the required permit conditions.</P>
                            <P>(2) Contractors or consultants may assist in completing applications or conducting work as a subpermittee but may not be a permit holder.</P>

                            </P>
                            <P>(4) Applicants may not combine projects if the activities are not readily identifiable as being part of the same project. If you want to obtain a consolidated permit for multiple activities, you must apply for a specific permit.</P>
                            <P>(5) General permits are issued to a single permit holder. If multiple entities operate a joint project and want to obtain joint authorization, the application must designate one entity as the permit holder and that entity must accept the legal liability for the other entities. The other entities must grant sufficient authority to the permit holder to carry out any activities required under the permit.</P>
                            <P>(6) The Service may notify you in writing that you must apply for a specific permit if the Service finds that the project does not comply with the requirements for a general permit.</P>

                                 The Service will regularly evaluate whether the take of bald eagles and golden eagles under general permits remains compatible with the preservation of eagles. If the Service finds, through analysis of the best available information, that the general permit program is not compatible with the preservation of bald eagles or golden eagles, the Service may suspend issuing general permits in all or in part after publishing notification in the 
                                <E T="04">Federal Register</E>

Subpermittees must have the conditions of authorization and, if applicable, a copy of the permit readily available. Subpermittees who are not employees must also have a subpermittee-designation letter.</P>
                            <P>(b) The Service may amend, suspend, or revoke a permit issued under this subpart if new information indicates that revised permit conditions are necessary, or that suspension or revocation is necessary, to safeguard local or regional eagle populations. This provision is in addition to the general criteria for amendment, suspension, and revocation of Federal permits set forth in §§ 13.23, 13.27, and 13.28 of this subchapter.</P>
                            <P>(c) Notwithstanding the provisions of § 13.26 of this subchapter, you remain responsible for all outstanding monitoring requirements and mitigation measures required under the terms of the permit for take that occurs prior to cancellation, expiration, suspension, or revocation of the permit.</P>

                            <SUBJECT>Compensatory mitigation.</SUBJECT>
                            <P>(a) Your permit conditions may include a requirement to compensate for the take of eagles.</P>
                            <P>(1) Any permit authorizing take that would exceed the applicable EMU take limit will require compensatory mitigation, except in circumstances where the action is considered in the best interest of an eagle. Compensatory mitigation for this purpose must ensure the preservation of the affected eagle species by mitigating an amount equal to or greater than the authorized or expected take. Compensatory mitigation must either reduce another ongoing form of mortality or increase the eagle population of the affected species. Compensatory mitigation for golden eagles must be performed at a 1.2:1 (mitigation: take) ratio.</P>
                            <P>(2) A permit may require compensatory mitigation when the Service determines, according to the best available information, that the take authorized by the permitted activity is not consistent with maintaining the persistence of the local area population of an eagle species.</P>
                            <P>(b) All required compensatory mitigation actions must:</P>
                            <P>(1) Be contingent upon application of avoidance and minimization measures to reduce the take to the maximum degree practicable relative to the magnitude of the project's impacts on eagles.</P>
                            <P>(2) Be sited within:</P>
                            <P>(i) The same EMU where the permitted take will occur; or</P>
                            <P>(ii) Another EMU if the Service has reliable data showing that the population affected by the take includes individuals that are reasonably likely to use that EMU during part of their seasonal migration.</P>
                            <P>(3) If required by the Service, be sited within a specified local area population.</P>
                            <P>(4) Use the best available science in formulating, crediting, and monitoring the long-term effectiveness of mitigation measures.</P>
                            <P>(5) Be additional to and improve upon the baseline conditions for the affected eagle species in a manner that is demonstrably new and would not have occurred without the compensatory mitigation.</P>
                            <P>(6) Be durable and, at a minimum, maintain its intended purpose for as long as required by the mitigation conditions in the permit.</P>
                            <P>(7) Include mechanisms to account for and address uncertainty and risk of failure of a compensatory mitigation measure.</P>
                            <P>(8) Include financial assurances that the required compensatory mitigation measures will be implemented in full.</P>
                            <P>(c) Compensatory mitigation must be approved by the Service and may include conservation banks, in-lieu fee programs, or permittee-responsible mitigation as mitigation providers.</P>
                            <P>
                                (1) General permittees meet this requirement by obtaining required credits from a Service-approved, third-party mitigation provider. Specific permittees can meet this requirement by obtaining required credits from a Service-approved, third-party mitigation provider or meeting the requirements to be a permittee-responsible mitigation provider as described in paragraph (c)(2) of this section. Third-party mitigation providers (
                                <E T="03">e.g.,</E>
                                 in-lieu fee programs and conservation banks) obtain Service approval by meeting the requirements to be a mitigation provider as described in paragraph (c)(2) of this section.
                            </P>
                            <P>
                                (2) To obtain approval as a mitigation provider, potential providers must submit a mitigation plan to the Service that demonstrates how the standards set forth in paragraph (b) of this section will be met. At a minimum, this must include a description of the mitigation, the benefit to eagles, the locations where 
                                <PRTPAGE P="9962"/>
                                projects will be implemented, the EMU and local area population affected, the number of credits provided, and an explanation of the rationale for the number of eagle credits provided. The Service must approve the mitigation plan prior to implementation.

When notifying the Service, you must include the reporting data required by your permit conditions, your adaptive management plan, and a description and justification of the adaptive management approaches you will implement for the remaining duration of your general permit term. The project will remain authorized to incidentally take eagles through the term of the existing general permit but will not be eligible for future general permits. You may instead apply for a specific permit for incidental take at that project. You may request reconsideration of general-permit eligibility by following the review procedures set forth at § 13.29 of this subchapter, including providing the information required in § 13.29(b)(3).</P>

                                 A power-pole configuration designed to minimize avian electrocution risk by providing sufficient separation between phases and between phases and grounds to accommodate the wrist-to-wrist or head-to-foot distance of the bird. For eagles, this is 150 centimeters of horizontal separation and 100 centimeters of vertical separation. If sufficient separation cannot be provided, exposed parts that conduct electricity must be covered to reduce electrocution risk. If covers are used, they must be maintained in good condition. For conversions from an above-ground line to a buried line, the buried portion is considered “avian-safe.” For purposes of the regulations in this section, “avian-safe” means safe for eagles.

                                 A plan to convert existing infrastructure to avian-safe infrastructure within a set timeline. The strategy must identify a baseline of poles to be proactively retrofit. The existing-infrastructure baseline must include all poles that are not avian-safe for eagles located in areas identified as high risk to eagles and may also include other poles in the service area.

The reactive retrofit strategy must include information on how eagle electrocutions are detected and identified. Determining which poles to retrofit must be based on the risk to eagles and not on other factors (

The strategy must include a protocol for immediately contacting the Office of Law Enforcement (in no case more than 72 hours from discovery) when finding eagle remains or an injured eagle near power line infrastructure in circumstances that suggest the eagle may have been shot. If multiple shooting events occur in the service area during the permit tenure, the strategy should describe and provide for the implementation of reasonable shooting-reduction measures.</P>

                                 The regulations in this section authorize the take of bald eagles or golden eagles by disturbance, as defined in § 22.6. Apply using Form 3–200–91. Permits to authorize disturbance associated with hazing eagles or eagle nest take are not authorized under this section. A permit is not required when an activity that may ordinarily disturb eagles is ongoing at the time an eagle pair initiates nesting because the nesting eagles are presumed to tolerate the activity.

If permanent loss of a territory may occur, a specific permit is recommended because general permits for disturbance do not authorize the permanent loss of a territory. General permits are not available if the nest is located in Indian country (18 U.S.C. 1151), unless the Tribe is the applicant. The following activities are eligible for a general permit:

                    <P>
                        1. In this Order, the Commission adopts several proposals from the 
                        <E T="03">Data Breach Notice,</E>
                         88 FR 3953 (Jan. 23, 2023), to modernize its data breach requirements. The Commission's breach notification rule provides an important protection against improper use or disclosure of customer data, helping to ensure that carriers are held accountable and providing customers with the tools to protect themselves in the event that their data is compromised. However, in the 16 years since the Commission adopted its data breach reporting rule—designed to protect customers against the threat of “pretexting”—data breaches have only grown in frequency and severity. As discussed below, the Commission finds that these changes will better protect consumers from improper use or disclosure of their customer information and harmonize its rules with new approaches to protecting the public already deployed by the Commission's partners in Federal and State government. To the extent that this Report and Order does not expressly address a topic that was subject to comment in the 
                        <E T="03">Data Breach Notice,</E>
                         that issue remains pending.

                    <P>2. The Commission first expands the scope of its breach notification rules to cover not just CPNI, but all PII. The Commission next adopts its proposal to expand its definition of “breach” for telecommunications carriers to include inadvertent access, use, or disclosure of customer information, except in those cases where such information is acquired in good faith by an employee or agent of a carrier, and such information is not used improperly or further disclosed. The Commission also adopts its proposal to require carriers to notify the Commission, in addition to the Secret Service and FBI, as soon as practicable, but no later than seven business days, after reasonable determination of a breach. The Commission next eliminates the requirement that carriers notify customers of a breach in cases where a carrier can reasonably determine that no harm to customers is reasonably likely to occur as a result of the breach. The Commission also eliminates the mandatory waiting period for carriers to notify customers, and instead requires carriers to notify customers of breaches of covered data without unreasonable delay after notification to Federal agencies, and in no case more than 30 days following reasonable determination of a breach, unless a delay is requested by law enforcement. Finally, to ensure that TRS consumers enjoy the same level of protection under its rules as consumers of telecommunications services, the Commission adopts equivalent requirements for TRS providers.</P>

                         the Commission recognized that carriers possess proprietary information of customers other than CPNI, which customers have an interest in protecting from public exposure; the notice sought comment on requiring carriers to report breaches of such information.

                        4. The pervasiveness of data breaches and the frequency of breach notifications have evolved and increased since the Commission first adopted its breach notification rule in 2007. As discussed in the 
                        <E T="03">Data Breach Notice,</E>
                         the Commission's requirement is one of several sector-specific Federal breach notification laws in the United States. All State data breach notification requirements explicitly include categories of sensitive personal information within their scope, as do sector-specific Federal laws. The Commission believes that the unauthorized exposure of sensitive personal information that the carrier has received from the customer (
                        <E T="03">i.e.,</E>
                         information “of the customer”), or about the customer (
                        <E T="03">i.e.,</E>
                         information “relating to” the customer), in connection with the customer relationship (
                        <E T="03">e.g.,</E>
                         initiation, provision, or maintenance, of service), such as social security numbers or financial records, is reasonably likely to pose risk of customer harm. Accordingly, any unauthorized disclosure of such information warrants 
                        <PRTPAGE P="9969"/>
                        notification to the customer, the Commission, and other law enforcement. Consumers expect that they will be notified of substantial breaches that endanger their privacy, and businesses that handle sensitive personal information should expect to be obligated to report such breaches.
                    </P>
                    <P>
                        5. The Commission requires notification of breaches that involve PII, which is a well-understood concept and thus a readily administrable way of requiring breach notifications in the case of proprietary information. The Commission rejects claims that it did not provide sufficient notice to define the scope of protected consumer information in this manner. In the 
                        <E T="03">Data Breach Notice</E>
                         the Commission sought comment on “requir[ing] telecommunications carriers to report breaches of proprietary information other than CPNI under Section 222(a),” in which case commenters were asked to address “how broadly or narrowly [the Commission should] define that category of information.” This provided notice that the Commission could define the scope of protected information to encompass all or any subset of the universe of proprietary information encompassed by section 222(a). And as the Commission explains below, the scope of customer information encompassed by section 222(a) is best interpreted to include PII, and the Commission defines the scope of its breach notification rules to include PII subject to the additional limitations that the Commission adopts below. The Commission therefore concludes that there was sufficient notice for the approach the Commission adopt. The definition of PII is aptly described in OMB Circular A-130, “Managing Information as a Strategic Resource,” as “information that can be used to distinguish or trace an individual's identity, either alone or when combined with other information that is linked or linkable to a specific individual.” CPNI is a subset of PII. As discussed below, this approach of holding carriers responsible for reporting breaches of PII is supported independently and alternatively by construing the phrase “proprietary information of . . . customers” in section 222(a) as covering all information defined as PII, and by recognizing that section 201(b)'s just-and-reasonable-practices obligation requires protection of PII.
                    </P>
                    <P>6. For the purposes of its breach notification rules, the Commission further defines the scope of covered PII as (1) first name or first initial, and last name, in combination with any government-issued identification numbers or information issued on a government document used to verify the identity of a specific individual (including, but not limited to, Social Security Number, driver's license number or State identification number, Taxpayer Identification Number, passport number, military identification number, Tribal identification card, or any other Federal or State government-issued identification card), or other unique identification number used for authentication purposes (including, but not limited to, a financial institution account number, student identification number, or medical identification number); (2) user name or email address, in combination with a password or security question and answer, or any other authentication method or information necessary to permit access to an account (including, but not limited to, Personal Identification Numbers, private keys that are unique to an individual and are used to authenticate or sign an electronic record; unique electronic identifiers or routing codes, in combination with any required security code, access code, or password that would permit access to an individual's financial account; or shared secrets or security tokens that are known to be used for data-based authentication); or (3) unique biometric, genetic, or medical data (including, but not limited to, fingerprints, faceprint, a retinal or iris scan, hand geometry, voiceprint analysis, or other unique biometric data generated from a measurement or analysis of human body characteristics to authenticate or ascertain an individual's identity; genetic data such as deoxyribonucleic acid data; and medical records, or other information regarding an individual's medical history, mental or physical condition, or medical treatment or diagnosis by a health care professional). Moreover, dissociated data that, if linked, would constitute PII is to be considered PII if the means to link the dissociated data were accessed in connection with access to the dissociated data, and any one of the discrete data elements listed above or any combination of the discrete data elements listed above is PII if the data element or combination of data elements would enable a person to commit identity theft or fraud against the individual to whom the data element or elements pertain.</P>
                    <P>7. This approach brings the Commission's definition of covered data in line with the approaches taken at the State level, and responds to concerns raised in the record by certain parties regarding harmonization with existing breach notification regimes. In order to further harmonize its approach with analogous State law, the Commission also adopts an exception from its definition of PII for publicly available information that is lawfully made available to the general public from Federal, State, or local government records or widely distributed media. Notwithstanding these limitations, the Commission will monitor the data security landscape and will not hesitate to revisit and revise the list of data elements in a future rulemaking as necessary to ensure that carriers adequately protect sensitive customer data.</P>
                    <P>
                        8. Without an FCC rule requiring breach notifications for the above categories of PII, there would be no requirement in Federal law that telecommunications carriers report non-CPNI breaches to their customers. CTIA's objection that doing so would “[c]reat[e] a system of dual jurisdiction between the FCC and the FTC” is unpersuasive. CTIA asserts that “[c]ustomers do not expect different privacy protections for the same data depending on which entity holds the data or the kind of product or service that is being marketed” but concedes the FTC's lack of authority in the common carrier context. By the statutory design of the Communications Act and the FTC Act, Congress assigned differing areas of responsibility to the FCC and FTC, and CTIA identifies no grounds for the Commission to ignore its responsibilities with respect to common carriers. By ensuring that the same data breach notification requirements also apply to interconnected VoIP and TRS providers, the Commission advances the interest of ensuring that consumers can have the same expectations regarding services that they view as similar. The approach the Commission adopts therefore not only reflects the practical expectations of consumers but also honors the intention of Congress. For example, as discussed in more detail below, Congress ratified the Commission's 2007 decision to extend section 222-based privacy protections for telecommunications service customers to the customers of interconnected VoIP providers. And ensuring equivalent protections for TRS subscribers advances Congress' directive to endeavor to ensure functionally equivalent service. Despite NCTA's suggestion that “there is no other `proprietary information' between a provider and its customer that is not CPNI but is covered by Section 222,” the Commission has investigated several instances of breaches involving 
                        <PRTPAGE P="9970"/>
                        sensitive personal information about customers held by telecommunications carriers that was not or may not have been CPNI. The Commission has also in the past concluded that names, addresses, and telephone numbers are not CPNI, even when a customer has elected not to have them disclosed publicly, and that such information therefore would not be subject to the CPNI-specific restrictions on use in section 222(c). The Commission finds that such information can be sensitive and warrants protection, including a requirement that the Commission, law enforcement, and customers be notified about breaches. Indeed, because consumers expect to be notified of substantial breaches that endanger their privacy, it better protects customers that breach notifications not turn on whether a particular breached element is or is not CPNI.

                        9. Consistent with the 
                        <E T="03">Data Breach Notice'</E>
                        s proposal, the Commission expands the Commission's definition of “breach” to include inadvertent access, use, or disclosure of covered data. Specifically, the Commission defines “breach” as any instance in which a person, without authorization or exceeding authorization, has gained access to, used, or disclosed covered data. While the practice of pretexting that spurred the Commission to act in 2007 necessarily involves an intent to gain access to customer information, the record before the Commission here amply demonstrates that the inadvertent exposure of customer information can result in the loss and misuse of sensitive information by scammers and phishers, and trigger a need to inform the affected individuals so that they can take appropriate steps to protect themselves and their information. The Commission agrees with the wide range of commenters that recognize that any exposure of customer data can risk harming consumers, regardless of whether the exposure was intentional. As the Accessibility Advocacy and Research Organizations (AARO) argue, “[t]he Commission must adapt to an ever changing technological environment, which implicates all kinds of privacy concerns, and adopt measures that can effectively counter increasingly complex and evolving breaches.” In order to address these risks, carriers not only must reasonably protect covered information as required by the Act and the Commission's rules, but also must inform affected individuals so that they can take appropriate steps to protect themselves and their information where breaches occur. In addition, notification of both intentional and unintentional breaches to the Commission and other Federal law enforcement will aid investigations and help prevent new breaches or further harm to consumers. The Commission expects that its broadening of “breach” to include inadvertent exposure will encourage telecommunications carriers to adopt stronger data security practices, and will help Federal agencies identify and address systemic network vulnerabilities.

                    <P>
                        10. The record supports the Commission's observation in the 
                        <E T="03">Data Breach Notice</E>
                         that breaches have become more prevalent and more severe in recent years. In 2021, the Identity Theft Resource Center “estimated a record-breaking 1,862 data breaches,” and a survey from IBM has exposed “a recent decline in response capabilities” due to “informal or ad hoc” data security plans. This rising tide of data breaches has affected the telecommunications sector as well. As the Electronic Privacy Information Center (EPIC) points out, the proprietary information of subscribers of each of the three largest carriers “has been breached at least once within the last five years.” Indeed, in February 2020, the Commission proposed more than $200 million in fines against AT&amp;T, Sprint, T-Mobile, and Verizon, for apparently failing to adequately protect consumer location data. In each case, the Commission found that the carriers' apparently lacked adequate oversight over third-party location aggregators' use of their phone subscribers' location data, leading to the disclosure of their respective customers' location information, without consent, to third parties who were not authorized to receive it.
                    </P>
                    <P>11. Given these worrying trends, the Commission agrees with EPIC that its expansion of “breach” to include inadvertent exposures is a necessary first step to galvanize carriers to strengthen their data security policies and oversight of customer data. In particular, broadening the breach definition will better enable the marketplace to respond to the relative strengths of particular carriers' practices and enhance the Commission's ability to identify where additional regulatory oversight might be needed. Removing the intent limitation in the Commission's breach reporting rule will reduce ambiguity regarding whether reporting a breach is necessary, and therefore decrease the risk of underreporting. Finally, the Commission's expansion of “breach” to include inadvertent access, use, or disclosure of customer information brings the Commission's rules in line with the overwhelming majority of State and Federal breach notification laws and regulations that lack such an intent limitation, ensuring that consumers nationwide—along with the Commission and other relevant Federal authorities—likewise receive critical breach notifications in a timely manner.</P>
                    <P>
                        12. Notwithstanding these benefits, the Commission acknowledges concerns expressed by carriers that its expansion of the “breach” definition to include inadvertent disclosures, on its own, could lead to “notice fatigue” for consumers, deplete Commission and law enforcement resources, or increase the burden of reporting obligations. The Commission is unpersuaded by the arguments of Lincoln Network, which goes even further and contends that data breach reporting requirements would implicate the major questions doctrine. Lincoln Networks focuses solely on the alleged economic impact of the requirement to the exclusion of other considerations, and even then provides no meaningful sense of the likely magnitude of such effects—citing total estimated economic costs of breaches and asserting in a conclusory manner that “it is reasonable to conclude that at least some of the cost per breach is assignable to notification,” without quantifying the cost associated with such notifications, let alone any portion attributable specifically to FCC breach notification rules. The Commission thus is unpersuaded that the major questions doctrine is implicated here. In any case, the Commission explains below why these rules fall comfortably within the Commission's statutory authority. In response to these concerns, as discussed below, the Commission exempt from its expanded definition of “breach” a good-faith acquisition of customer data by an employee or agent of a carrier where such information is not used improperly or further disclosed. The Commission also adopts a “harm-based notification trigger,” such that notification of a breach to consumers is not required in cases where a carrier can reasonably determine that no harm to customers is reasonably likely to occur as a result of the breach, or where the breach solely involves encrypted data and the carrier has definitive evidence that the encryption key was not also accessed, used, or disclosed. As discussed below, the Commission also finds that its adoption of a minimum threshold for the number of customers affected to trigger its requirement to notify the Commission and other Federal law 
                        <PRTPAGE P="9971"/>
                        enforcement regarding breaches where there is no reasonable likelihood of harm will further reduce carriers' reporting burdens, and make more efficient use of agencies' resources. Although carriers' obligation to protect covered information under section 222 of the Act and the Commission's implementing rules is not limited just to scenarios where there is actual evidence of consumer harms, these common-sense limitations on the Commission's disclosure requirements are well-supported by the record and are consistent with most State and Federal data breach notification regimes. Taken together, the Commission finds that these carve-outs will mitigate any legitimate concerns expressed by commenters in the record regarding the potential for consumer notice fatigue and undue burdens on Federal agencies and carriers by triggering the requirements in situations where the Commission finds disclosures most strongly justified.

                        13. In the 
                        <E T="03">Data Breach Notice,</E>
                         the Commission also sought comment on whether it should “expand the definition of a breach to include situations where a telecommunications carrier or a third party discovers conduct that could have reasonably led to exposure of customer CPNI, even if it has not yet determined if such exposure occurred.” Commenters generally oppose such an expansion, arguing that it could result in over-notification to customers and to government entities, impeding carriers' and the government's investigation of actual breaches, and needlessly frightening consumers. While the Commission believes that notification of situations in which customer data are put at risk has value, no commenter in the record provides evidence in support of such an approach. The Commission nevertheless expects that in such situations, carriers will work reasonably and efficiently to confirm whether or not actual exposure has occurred. While the Commission declines at this time to amend the definition of breach to include situations where a carrier or third party has not yet determined if an exposure of covered data has occurred, the Commission also notes that it does not prohibit carriers from providing notice in such situations to their customers if, for example, they determine that doing so is appropriate under the circumstances. While the Commission has not expanded the definition of data breach to include situations where customer data is put at risk but not exposed, it notes that the threshold for reporting a breach is separate from the obligation to “protect the confidentiality of proprietary information” and to “take reasonable measures to discover and protect against attempts to gain unauthorized access to CPNI.” 47 U.S.C. 222(a); 47 CFR 64.2010(a). Not only may a breach that does not meet the reporting threshold still reflect a violation of section 222 of the Act or an unreasonable practice in violation of 64.2010(a) of the rules, but a carrier can violate section 222 of the Act or section 64.2010(a) of the rules even in the absence of any breach. The Commission also will continue to monitor how such situations impact customers, and reserve the ability to expand the breach definition to cover such situations in the future, should the Commission find such an expansion is warranted.

                    <P>
                        14. The Commission excludes from the definition of “breach” a good-faith acquisition of covered data by an employee or agent of a carrier where such information is not used improperly or further disclosed. In the 
                        <E T="03">Data Breach Notice,</E>
                         the Commission used the term “exemption” instead of “exception” when asking commenters whether the Commission should exclude from the definition of “breach” a good-faith acquisition of covered data. For the purpose of clarity, the Commission instead uses the word “exception” here to describe this exclusion. While the Commission makes this exception to its definition of “breach,” it nevertheless expects carriers to “take reasonable measures” in such scenarios to protect such customer information from improper use or further disclosure, which may, for example, involve requiring that such an employee or agent destroy the data upon realizing that the data was disclosed without, or in excess of, authorization. As noted above and in the 
                        <E T="03">Data Breach Notice,</E>
                         the vast majority of State statutes include a similar exception from the definition of “breach,” and commenters overwhelmingly agree that such an exception is appropriate. As Blooston Rural Carriers argues, a good-faith exception will prevent carriers from “unnecessarily confus[ing] and alarm[ing] consumers” in such low-risk situations. The Commission also agrees with National Rural Electric Cooperative Association (NRECA) that, without this exception, “more serious data breaches [will potentially] become lost in the `noise' of multiple notifications.” The Commission therefore finds that its good-faith exception will help avoid excessive notifications to consumers, and reduce reporting burdens on carriers. CTIA and NCTA's arguments about the Commission's allegedly overly broad definition of harm to trigger customer notifications of breaches of covered data, and their expressed concerns about excessive reporting to Federal agencies, do not account for the fact that this good-faith exception removes an entire category of breaches from the scope of reporting covered by the Commission's rules as a threshold matter. As a result, the Commission is unpersuaded by these parties' cursory claims about possible notice fatigue, consumer confusion or frustration, and interference with data breach investigations.
                    </P>
                    <P>15. The Commission disagrees with EPIC that its adoption of a good-faith exception would “weaken privacy and data security protections for consumers.” In support of these claims, EPIC cites instances in which employees, “either through bribery or inadequate training, were illegally disclosing consumer information to pretexters claiming to have authorization to access subscriber information.” The Commission does not find that these situations justify taking a different approach; indeed, the exception the Commission adopts would not apply in the scenarios outlined by EPIC. First, the good-faith exception relieves carriers from reporting obligations only where customer information is not used improperly or further disclosed, and in EPIC's example, the information was, intentionally or not, further disclosed to a pretexter. Second, in circumstances where an employee improperly discloses consumer information due to bribery, the employee disclosing the information is, by definition, not acting in “good faith,” and therefore such an incident would still be considered a breach under the Commission's rules.</P>

                        <E T="03">Data Breach Notice,</E>
                         the Commission requires telecommunications carriers to notify the Commission of a breach in addition to notification to the Secret Service and FBI. The Commission continues to require carriers to notify the Secret Service and the FBI because doing so enables law enforcement to investigate the breach, “which could result in legal action against the perpetrators, thus ensuring that they do not continue to breach CPNI.” Moreover, law enforcement investigations into how breaches occurred would enable law 
                        <PRTPAGE P="9972"/>
                        enforcement to advise the carrier and the Commission to take steps to prevent future breaches of that kind. The Commission will maintain a link to the reporting facility at 
                        <E T="03">http://www.fcc.gov/eb/cpni</E>
                         or a successor URL designated by the Wireline Competition Bureau (Bureau). As the Commission found when it adopted the current data breach rules, notifying law enforcement of a breach is consistent with the goal of protecting customers' personal data because it enables such agencies to investigate the breach, “which could result in legal action against the perpetrators,” thus ensuring that they do not continue to breach sensitive customer information. The Commission also anticipated that law enforcement investigations into how breaches occurred would enable law enforcement to advise providers and the Commission to take steps to anticipate and prevent future breaches of a similar nature. Addition of the Commission as a recipient of Federal-agency breach notifications is consistent with other Federal sector-specific laws, which require prompt notification to the relevant subject-matter agency. As large-scale security breaches resulting from lax or inadequate data security practices and employee training have become more common since the 
                        <E T="03">2007 CPNI Order,</E>
                         notifying the Commission of breaches will provide Commission staff with important information about data security vulnerabilities and threat patterns that Commission staff can help address and remediate. Commission notification will also shed light on carriers' ongoing compliance with the Commission's rules. Consistent with its proposal and the record in response to the 
                        <E T="03">Data Breach Notice,</E>
                         the Commission requires carriers to notify the Commission of a reportable breach contemporaneously with the Secret Service and FBI. As stated in the 
                        <E T="03">Data Breach Notice,</E>
                         requiring carriers to notify the Commission, Secret Service, and FBI at the same time will minimize burdens on carriers, eliminate confusion regarding obligations, and streamline the reporting process, allowing carriers to free up resources that can be used to address the breach and prevent further harm. Commenters support a single, contemporaneous notification to the Commission, Secret Service, and FBI.
                    </P>
                    <P>17. The majority of commenters support including the Commission in data breach notifications. WISPA opposes contemporaneous notification to the Commission “[i]f the Commission were to require separate notice.” Because the Commission is not requiring separate notification to the Commission, but are merely adding the Commission as a recipient of breach notifications submitted through the preexisting central reporting facility, the Commission expects that this should allay WISPA's concern. Many of these commenters agree, however, that this new notification requirement should not create new obligations which are duplicative or inconsistent with the preexisting requirement to notify law enforcement agencies, and should instead entail one notification sent to all three. The Commission agrees with these suggestions, as the Commission sees no need for carriers to file separate or differing notifications to the Commission. As discussed below, the Commission delegates authority to the Bureau to coordinate with the Secret Service to adapt the existing central reporting facility for reporting breaches to the Commission and other Federal law enforcement agencies. Additionally, as discussed below, the Commission does not impose differing content requirements for notifications to the different agencies.</P>
                    <P>18. The Commission disagrees with commenters that oppose requiring breach notification to the Commission. For example, ITI and WISPA argue that the existing requirement to notify the Secret Service and the FBI is sufficient, and that notification to the Commission is unnecessary. WISPA also argues that notification to the Commission would hinder law enforcement investigation efforts, and attempts to distinguish the other Federal regulations that require notification to sector-specific agencies as less burdensome than the Commission notification adopted here. The Commission is unpersuaded by these arguments. First, as mentioned above, the requirement to notify the Commission of covered data breaches is necessary to ensure that Commission staff are informed of new types of security vulnerabilities that arise in today's fast-changing data security environment. Additionally, the Commission disagrees with WISPA that adding the Commission as a recipient of Federal-agency notifications would hinder law enforcement investigation efforts, given the lack of impact the addition will have on the timing, content, or format of notification to the other law enforcement agencies. Indeed, the Secret Service is supportive of the Commission receiving such notifications. Furthermore, the Commission's action here avoids adding any additional burden on filers by merely adding the Commission to the list of recipients of the same breach notifications Commission rules already require carriers to submit, and, as discussed in further detail below, further streamlines the filing process by adapting the existing reporting facility for submission. This should also address WISPA's concern that a contemporaneous, but separate, notice to the Commission would impact initial efforts to assess a breach. For these reasons, the Commission does not expect carriers of any size to experience increased regulatory burdens as a result of the Commission notification requirement. Moreover, to the extent that carriers are faced with any minimal burdens, such burdens are well justified by the value of these reports to Federal law enforcement agencies and the Commission.</P>

                    <P>
                        19. The Commission requires carriers to inform Federal agencies, via the central reporting facility, of all breaches, regardless of the number of customers affected or whether there is a reasonable risk of harm to customers. For breaches that affect 500 or more customers, or for which a carrier cannot determine how many customers are affected, the Commission requires carriers to file individual, per-breach notifications as soon as practicable, but no later than seven business days, after reasonable determination of a breach. As described below, these notifications must include detailed information regarding the nature of the breach and its impact on affected customers. This same type of notification, and the seven business day timeframe for submission, will also be required in instances where the carrier has conclusively determined that a breach affects fewer than 500 customers unless the carrier can reasonably determine that no harm to customers is reasonably likely to occur as a result of the breach. As discussed below, for breaches affecting fewer than 500 customers and which do not meet the harm-based trigger, the Commission instead requires carriers to submit an annual summary of such incidents. For breaches in which a carrier can reasonably determine that a breach affecting fewer than 500 customers is not reasonably likely to harm those customers, the Commission requires the carrier to file an annual summary of such breaches via the central reporting facility, instead of a notification. To ensure that carriers may be held accountable regarding their determinations of a breach's likelihood of harm and number of affected customers, the Commission requires carriers to keep records of the bases of those determinations for two years. The 
                        <PRTPAGE P="9973"/>
                        Commission also notes that carriers may voluntarily file notification of such a breach in addition to, but not in place of, this annual summary filing. In circumstances where a carrier initially determines that contemporaneous breach notification to Federal agencies is not required under these provisions, but later discovers information that would require such notice, the Commission clarifies that a carrier must report the breach to Federal agencies as soon as practicable, but no later than seven business days of their discovery of this new information. For example, if a carrier initially determines that Federal agency notification within seven business days is not required because a breach affects fewer than 500 customers and harm to customers is not reasonably likely to occur, but later discovers new information suggesting that more than 500 customers were affected, or that harm to customers has occurred, or is likely to occur, as a result of the breach, then the carrier must notify Federal agencies as soon as practicable, but no later than within seven business days of this discovery.
                    </P>
                    <P>20. Given the Commission's expansion of the definition of “breach” in today's Order to include inadvertent exposure of CPNI and other types of data, allowing carriers to file information regarding smaller, less risky breaches in a summary format on an annual basis will tailor administrative burdens on carriers to reflect those scenarios where reporting is most critical. The Commission is unpersuaded by NCTA's contention that its rule for data breach reporting to Federal agencies is “likely to tax resources and limit the regulator's ability to identify the most problematic practices and act to protect consumers” and result in harm due to lack of harmonization. The Commission is likewise unpersuaded by CTIA's similar contention that “the FCC is not currently equipped to `become a repository for threat detection and monitoring' ” and that the “flood of information threatens to distract FCC and Law Enforcement staff from real and potentially harmful security threats.” These parties offer only generalized assertions in that regard without any evidence or analysis demonstrating concrete harms that are likely to result in practice. At the same time, NCTA and CTIA appear to neglect the potential the Commission anticipates for Federal agencies to gain useful insight into trends or particular activities that can lead to consumer harm even if, in a given instance, the reported breach happened not to involve consumer harm (whether under the standard set by Commission rules or in NCTA's and/or CTIA's own subjective judgment). The Commission's setting of a notification threshold is consistent with many State statutes that similarly do not have an intentionality requirement and require notice to State law enforcement authorities. The Commission's adoption of a 500-affected-customer threshold is also consistent with an analogous breach of health records notification required by the Federal Trade Commission (FTC).</P>
                    <P>21. The vast majority of commenters are supportive of the need for a threshold trigger generally, but are divergent regarding what the numerical threshold should be. NCTA supports a threshold of 500 affected customers for Federal-agency notifications, noting that such a threshold would “minimize paperwork burdens on providers that wish to focus their resources on protecting customers,” and cites a variety of State laws that use that threshold. CTIA and Verizon, however, argue that the Commission should set the threshold to be higher than 1,000 to reflect the larger customer bases of larger carriers. CTIA and Verizon do not provide additional reasoning as to why the size of the carrier's customer base is relevant in determining the threshold for Federal-agency notification. If the rationale for adopting a higher threshold for larger carriers is to reduce reporting burdens, the Commission notes that larger carriers likely have more resources than smaller carriers to respond to breach incidents. Verizon, for example, admits that it has “a team of more than 1,000 professionals dedicated to implementing corporate-wide security controls and constantly monitoring networks to identify and respond to threats.” Additionally, the Commission and other Federal law enforcement agencies would likely have an investigative interest in breaches affecting 500 or more customers, regardless of the percentage of the overall customer base those customers represent.</P>
                    <P>22. The Commission finds that the reporting threshold it adopts will both enable the Commission to receive more granular information regarding larger breaches to aid its investigations while also being able to study trends in breach activity through reporting of smaller breaches in annual submissions. Given that a number of States have found such a balance with a 500-affected-customer threshold, the Commission's adoption of this threshold also carries the additional benefit of “increas[ing] harmonization with [S]tate breach notification statutes.” The Commission therefore also rejects rural carriers' suggestion that it adopt a 5,000-affected-customer threshold.</P>
                    <P>23. Finally, as supported by the record, the Commission applies this threshold trigger only to notifications to Federal agencies, and not to customer notifications. Breaches affecting even just a few customers can pose just as much risk to those customers as could breaches with wider impact. For this reason, as discussed above, the Commission continues to require carriers to notify Federal agencies within seven business days of breaches that implicate a reasonable risk of customer harm, regardless of the number of customers affected. Doing so will permit Federal agencies to investigate smaller breaches where there is a risk of customer harm, and also allow law enforcement agencies to request customer notification delays where such notice would “impede or compromise an ongoing or potential criminal investigation or national security,” as specified in the Commission's rules.</P>

                    <P>
                        24. The Commission retains its existing requirement that carriers notify Federal agencies of a reportable breach as soon as practicable, but no later than seven business days, after reasonable determination of the breach. As commenters point out, in the text of the 
                        <E T="03">Data Breach Notice,</E>
                         the Commission occasionally used the phrase “after discovery of a breach,” rather than “after reasonable determination of a breach” when discussing the appropriate timeframe for Federal-agency notification. However, as the Proposed Rules Appendix makes clear, “after discovery” was intended as shorthand, rather than a proposal to substantively change the existing “after reasonable determination of a breach” standard. While the 
                        <E T="03">Data Breach Notice</E>
                         proposed eliminating the seven business day deadline, based on the record in response, the Commission finds that the existing timeframe provides greater certainty for carriers and customers affected by breaches. The Commission agrees with ACA Connects that retaining the seven business day deadline properly balances the need to give carriers “reasonable time to prioritize remediation efforts before submitting notifications” with the need to ensure customers receive timely notifications regarding breaches affecting their data. The Commission also agrees with NTCA that there is insufficient evidence that the current timeline “is inadequate to accomplish the Commission's goals.” Particularly given its historical 
                        <PRTPAGE P="9974"/>
                        experience with a seven day deadline, the Commission is unpersuaded by conclusory assertions that meeting that deadline might not always be feasible. Additionally, the Commission agrees with NTCA that eliminating the seven business day deadline and only “requiring breaches to be reported `as soon as practicable' can be interpreted differently by different carriers or even by law enforcement and the Commission, thereby placing carriers at risk of inadvertently violating the Commission's rules if they construe `as soon as practicable' differently than the Commission.”
                    </P>
                    <P>
                        25. The Commission disagrees with the arguments of other commenters that removing the seven business day deadline is necessary to afford carriers of different sizes and means the flexibility to respond to an evolving breach situation and minimize consumer harm, while also providing accurate and detailed notifications to Federal agencies. Given agencies' ability to calibrate their resources based on the volume of notifications, and the Commission's practical experience dealing with investigations at a stage where information might only be preliminary or incomplete, the Commission rejects arguments that burdens on the Commission and other law enforcement agencies justify eliminating the seven day reporting deadline. Carriers have long been subject to the existing seven business day deadline, which was adopted in 2007, and, as EPIC notes, some State jurisdictions require notification to the State attorney general within 3 days. As the Commission points out above, ACA Connects and NTCA—both associations of small-to-medium-sized carriers with presumably fewer resources than larger carriers such as Verizon—support retaining the seven business day time limit. Even assuming, 
                        <E T="03">arguendo,</E>
                         that the seven business day deadline is a more burdensome or inflexible timeframe for small carriers with “limited personnel and/or resources,” the Commission still finds that the countervailing interest in ensuring customers are notified quickly of breaches affecting them outweighs this tailored burden. For this reason, as discussed below, the Commission also removes the seven business day mandatory waiting period between Federal-agency notification and customer notification. The Commission lastly clarifies that “reasonabl[y] determin[ing]” a breach has occurred does not mean reaching a conclusion regarding every fact surrounding a data security incident that may constitute a breach. Rather, a carrier will be treated as having “reasonabl[y] determin[ed]” that a breach has occurred when the carrier has information indicating that it is more likely than not that there was a breach.
                    </P>
                    <P>
                        26. While the Commission sets this outer bound for Federal-agency notifications, it expects that larger carriers with significant resources and staffing will routinely be providing notification of breaches to the Commission well within the seven business day deadline, and that other carriers should strive to do so as well. Indeed, the “as soon as practicable” standard may require such notifications be made in 
                        <E T="03">fewer</E>
                         days than the seven business day deadline, and a failure to swiftly report breaches may, depending on the circumstances, be untimely and unreasonable, even if within the seven business day deadline. For example, if a carrier has made all the determinations necessary to conclude that a breach should be reported to law enforcement after only a few days, it would be inconsistent with the “as soon as practicable” standard for the carrier to wait until the seventh business day—merely because that is the outer limit—before providing the required notice. The Enforcement Bureau will continue to investigate carriers that have neglected to provide timely notification to Federal agencies after a breach incident pursuant to its delegated authority.

                         The Commission requires carriers to submit, via the existing central reporting facility and no later than February 1, a consolidated summary of breaches that occurred over the course of the previous calendar year which affected fewer than 500 customers, and where the carrier could reasonably determine that no harm to customers was reasonably likely to occur as a result of the breach. The Commission delegates authority to the Bureau to coordinate with the Secret Service regarding any modification to the portal that may be necessary to permit the filing of this annual summary. The Commission also delegates authority to the Bureau, working in conjunction with the Public Safety and Homeland Security Bureau, and based on the record of this proceeding—or any additional notice and comment that might be warranted—to determine the content and format requirements of this filing and direct the Bureau to release a public notice announcing these requirements. The Commission instructs the Bureau to minimize the burdens on carriers by, for example, limiting the content required for each reported breach to that absolutely necessary to identify patterns or gaps that require further Commission inquiry. At a minimum, the Bureau should develop requirements that are less burdensome than what is required for individual breach submissions to the reporting facility, and consider streamlined ways for filers to report this summary information. The first annual report will be due the first February 1 after the Office of Management and Budget (OMB) approves the annual reporting requirement under the Paperwork Reduction Act. The first report should cover all breaches between the effective date of the annual reporting requirement and the remainder of the calendar year.

                    <P>
                        28. The Commission disagrees with CTIA's argument that “there is no regulatory goal served by mandating record keeping” for incidents affecting fewer customers than the notification threshold. NCTA argues that the annual reporting requirement would “not provide the Commission with meaningful information to serve its goals of identifying data breach patterns,” but does not provide more detail as to why such information would not be helpful. Breaches that are limited in scope may still reveal patterns or provide evidence of security vulnerabilities at an early stage. As noted in the 
                        <E T="03">Data Breach Notice</E>

                         notification of all breaches, regardless of the number of customers affected or a carrier's determination of harm, “could allow the Commission and Federal law enforcement to be `better positioned than individual carriers to develop expertise about the methods and motives' ” associated with breaches. The Commission therefore finds that this annual summary of smaller breaches will continue to enable the Commission and its Federal law enforcement partners to investigate, remediate, and deter smaller breaches.

                    <P>
                        29. The Commission also disagrees with NTCA and Southern Linc who argue that “requiring carriers to maintain records of any breaches that fall below the notification threshold `will place an unnecessary burden on carriers. . . .' ” On the contrary, the Commission finds that any burdens associated with the annual reporting requirement are likely to be well justified by the countervailing benefits discussed above. Nor do commenters objecting to the burden of the Commission's rules as unwarranted provide a quantification of their anticipated burdens that would overcome the benefits anticipated from those rules. Moreover, this single annual report containing a summary of such 
                        <PRTPAGE P="9975"/>
                        breaches will likely end up replacing numerous smaller breach notifications individually submitted via the central reporting facility throughout the year. Additionally, Commission rules already require carriers to “maintain a record of all instances where CPNI was disclosed or provided to third parties, or where third parties were allowed access to CPNI.” The first part of this requirement encompasses all disclosures of CPNI to third parties resulting from a data breach, and thus is broader than the small-breach reporting requirement the Commission adopts today, at least with regard to CPNI.

                    <HD SOURCE="HD3">4. Notification Contents</HD>
                    <P>30. The Commission maintains its existing requirements regarding the contents of data breach notifications to Federal law enforcement agencies, with a minor modification as noted below, and applies these same requirements to notifications to the Commission. The Commission agrees with comments submitted by WISPA arguing that “the information currently submitted through the FBI/Secret Service reporting facility is largely sufficient and that generally the same information should be reported” under its updated rules. The Commission also takes this opportunity to codify these categories of information in its rules to improve the ease of identifying the information that will be needed by regulated entities. Specifically, the Commission requires carriers to report, at a minimum, information relevant to the breach, including: carrier address and contact information; a description of the breach incident; the method of compromise; the date range of the incident; the approximate number of customers affected; an estimate of financial loss to the carrier and customers, if any; and the types of data breached. The Commission believes that these disclosures are sufficient to give the Commission and other Federal law enforcement agencies the information needed to determine appropriate next steps, such as, for example, conducting an investigation, determining and advising on how such a breach may be prevented in the future, and informing future rulemakings to protect consumers and businesses from harm. Carriers must update their initial breach notification report if: (1) the carrier learns that, in some material respect, the breach notification report initially submitted was incomplete or incorrect; or (2) additional information is acquired by or becomes known to the carrier after the submission of its initial breach notification report.</P>

In its comments, CCA states that, while it “does not take a position on the specific contents that should be included in all notifications to law enforcement, to the Commission, or to customers[,] . . . . [t]he detailed information currently reported to law enforcement for purposes of investigation and potential criminal charges is significantly broader than what is necessary and appropriate for the Commission's use.

                         ACA Connects, CTIA, and WTA request elimination of the requirement to include the billing addresses of affected customers in notifications. ACA Connects states that this reporting requirement has unclear investigative value, and its elimination would “minimize the personal information reported to the Commission and law enforcement agencies.” While the Commission acknowledges that Federal agencies have been directed to minimize the collection, use, storage, and disclosure of personal information to only that which is relevant and necessary to accomplish an authorized purpose, carriers are not in a position to know, in the absence of input from law enforcement agencies in this proceeding, which fields hold investigative value. Furthermore, because the portal was designed by law enforcement agencies themselves, the Commission must assume that their inclusion of this field reflects a determination that such information holds some investigative value. Finally, the Commission notes that the field is not currently marked as a required field. For this reason, the field does not present a reporting burden to carriers, but instead gives carriers an opportunity to provide Federal agencies more detail, should they wish to do so or find such detail relevant. WTA argues that “billing names and addresses . . . are not classified as CPNI,” and thus should be omitted from the form. The Commission's expansion of covered data to include information beyond CPNI renders this argument moot.

While it understands that estimating financial loss is a complex and context-specific calculation, the Commission emphasizes the critical importance of this data point in helping Federal agencies allocate their resources. Additionally, while carriers should strive to provide in their notifications as accurate a value as possible, the Commission notes that even a ballpark estimate or a range of quantities can help agencies determine an incident's priority for the purposes of opening or conducting investigations, and understand the magnitude of future risk posed by certain vulnerabilities.

                         CTIA identifies two fields which it argues are no longer necessary given the Commission's change to the reporting threshold for Federal-agency notifications, as discussed below. Specifically, CTIA requests that the Commission remove the fields regarding whether the breach “resulted from a change of [a customer's] billing address” or was based on “a personal issue between two individuals.” The Commission declines to do so. First, these fields are not marked as “required” on the form, and thus create no burden on reporting carriers that do not wish to complete them, while providing an opportunity for carriers to submit that information where applicable if they find it helpful or appropriate to do so. Second, under the Commission's revised rules, a breach stemming from a personal issue between two individuals or a change of a single customer's billing address may still trigger notification to Federal agencies. The reporting threshold only impacts the need to notify Federal agencies of breaches affecting fewer than 500 customers that do not implicate harm. As stated below, even small breaches may cause harm for the few customers affected by them. CTIA also requests elimination of the field that asks whether “the carrier believes that there is an extraordinarily urgent need to notify any class of affected customers” before “7 full business days have passed.” CTIA argues that “[r]emoving this field is consistent [with] the NPRM's proposal to eliminate the seven-business-day waiting period.” The Commission agrees with this suggestion as its abrogation of the seven

                         the Commission sought comment on whether it should require telecommunications carriers to report, at a minimum, the information required under the Cyber Incident Reporting for Critical Infrastructure Act of 2022 (CIRCIA) as part of their notifications to Federal agencies. While a few commenters support the alignment or harmonization of these data breach notifications with the requirements under CIRCIA, the Commission declines to take action in this regard at this early stage. CIRCIA directs the Cybersecurity and Infrastructure Security Agency (CISA) to publish a notice of proposed rulemaking implementing its notification provisions by March 15, 2024. The CISA must issue final rules no later than 18 months after the publication of the notice of proposed rulemaking. At the time of this Order, the CISA has not yet released the notice of proposed rulemaking. Therefore, the Commission finds it is too early to determine the precise contours of the final reporting requirements, and in the interest of preventing duplicative or inconsistent fields, and consistent with the approach advocated by ACA Connects, Blooston Rural Carriers, and CCA, the Commission will refrain from making additional changes based on CIRCIA and continue to monitor whether such changes may be required in the future.

                        36. The Commission does not find CTIA's comparison of its reporting trigger to that of the Critical Infrastructure Act of 2022 (CIRCIA) compelling. CIRCIA is concerned with the category of “incidents.” CIRCIA does not define “breaches.” But under Federal guidance to agencies, a breach is a specific type of incident—an incident that involves the loss of control, compromise, unauthorized disclosure, unauthorized acquisition (etc.) of PII. And it would not be inconsistent for only some incidents to be reportable under CIRCIA but for all breaches to be reportable under the Commission's rules. For example, for Federal agencies, for an incident to qualify as a “major incident” it must be likely to result in demonstrable harm to the national security interests, foreign relations, or the economy of the United States, or to the public confidence, civil liberties, or public health and safety of the American people. But for a “breach” to qualify as a major incident, it can either satisfy that qualitative threshold, 
                        <E T="03">or</E>
                         it can involve the PII of 100,000 or more people. Thus, the individual privacy concerns implicated by a breach justify a broader reporting trigger.

                    <P>
                        37. The Commission also disagrees with CTIA's characterization of CIRCIA's incident reporting framework. CTIA argues that CIRCIA's reporting framework “only applies—in a risk-based way—to `covered cyber incidents,' which must be `substantial' and do not include all incidents.' ” This argument misconstrues the statute. Section 2242(c)(2)(A) of CIRCIA sets a 
                        <E T="03">minimum</E>
                         on the types of “substantial cyber incidents that constitute covered cyber incidents” and implicitly allows the CISA to expand the definition beyond that in the course of its rulemaking. For example, one of those required minimums is to report “cyber incident[s] that lead[ ] to substantial loss of confidentiality, integrity, or availability of such information system or network, or a serious impact on the safety and resiliency of operational systems and processes.” While a rulemaking implementing CIRCIA is still pending, the CISA may define “loss of confidentiality” to include data breaches. The Commission further notes that the two statutory exceptions to “substantial cyber incidents that constitute covered cyber incidents” are narrow, and likely would not prevent the CISA from adopting implementing regulations that broaden the scope of covered cyber incidents that trigger the statute's reporting obligations.

                         the Commission sought comment on whether to forego requiring notification of a breach to customers or Federal agencies in those instances where a telecommunications carrier can reasonably determine that no harm to customers is reasonably likely to occur as a result of the breach. While the Commission adopts such a harm-based notification trigger for breach notifications to customers generally, as discussed below, it declines to do so for Federal-agency notifications of breaches that meet or exceed the 500-affected-customer threshold described above. For breaches that do not meet its reporting threshold of at least 500 affected customers, the Commission do not require notification to Federal agencies via the central reporting facility in those instances where a carrier can reasonably determine that no harm to customers is reasonably likely to occur as a result of the breach. The Commission does not believe that the rationale for adopting a harm-based notification trigger for customer notifications applies in the Federal-agency context. Specifically, unlike customers, Federal agencies do not have the same vulnerability to notice fatigue, confusion, stress, or financial hardship that would cause the burdens they experience from additional reporting to outweigh the benefits. CTIA argues that by not extending the harm-based trigger to Federal-agency notifications, the Commission risks that notifications will “inundate the Commission's breach reporting facility with information” and the “flood of information threatens to distract FCC and Law Enforcement staff from real and potentially harmful security threats.” As an initial matter, the Commission notes that, as private entities, CTIA and its members lack any particular insight into, or expertise regarding, the administrative burdens affecting Federal agencies with respect to these rules. Contrary to CTIA's unsupported assertions, the agencies affected by these breach notification rules do not anticipate significant costs associated with the breach reporting requirements the Commission adopts today. While the Commission agrees that receiving notifications or reports of breaches that carriers have reasonably concluded do not trigger customer notification under the harm-based trigger will require the use of 
                        <E T="03">some</E>
                         resources by the Commission and law enforcement agencies, the Commission finds the value of enabling Federal agencies to identify patterns and insecurities and monitor all breaches of covered data outweigh the marginal costs of receiving notifications or reports for breaches that fall in this category. Additionally, as mentioned above, a report regarding a breach that does not result in harm to customers could nevertheless aid Federal agencies in identifying patterns and potential vulnerabilities and develop expertise across the industry. Commenters argue that the Commission should adopt a harm-based notification trigger for all Federal-agency notifications to avoid draining carrier resources. While commenters are correct that a general harm-based trigger would likely serve to reduce carriers' reporting burdens, so too would a reporting threshold. The Commission finds that its adoption of a reporting threshold is better tailored to reducing carriers' burdens in the Federal-agency-notification context while maintaining appropriate benefits of reporting. Commenters also argue that a harm-based notification trigger is necessary to reduce burdens on government resources. Even assuming, 
                        <E T="03">arguendo,</E>
                         that such burdens exist, they would likely be outweighed by the countervailing public interest in Federal 
                        <PRTPAGE P="9977"/>
                        agencies receiving information concerning all breaches for investigative or trend analysis purposes. The Commission's threshold trigger ensures that Federal agencies receive breach information with the appropriate level of detail at the appropriate time given a breach's harmful impact or magnitude. the Commission's targeted application of a harm-based trigger to breaches affecting fewer than 500 customers ensures that Federal agencies are notified before customers and thereby have an opportunity to request a delay if necessary. This trigger also permits Federal agencies to investigate small breaches that are harmful sooner after the breach incident than in a carrier's annual report, as described above.

                         the Commission proposed to create and maintain a centralized portal for reporting breaches to the Commission and other Federal law enforcement agencies. After reviewing the record, the Commission instead requires carriers to use the existing data breach reporting facility for notifications to the Secret Service and FBI and delegate authority to the Bureau to coordinate with the Secret Service, the current administrator of the reporting facility, and the FBI, to the extent necessary, to ensure that the Commission will be notified when data breaches are reported and to implement the targeted modifications to the content of breach notifications that the Commission adopts today. The Commission's decision to require the same content and timing for notification to the Commission as for notification to the Secret Service and FBI supports the use of a single portal for notifying all three agencies. Consistent with the Secret Service's request, the Commission also delegates authority to the Bureau, working in conjunction with the Public Safety and Homeland Security Bureau and the Office of Managing Director, to collaborate with the Secret Service to explore the possibility of the Commission assuming control and responsibility for the reporting facility in the future, and to transition control of the facility to the Commission should the Bureau and Secret Service agree that such a transition is desirable.

                    <P>40. Commenters widely supported the use of a single portal for all Federal-agency notifications. ACA Connects argues that using the preexisting portal for Commission notification will save government resources that would otherwise be spent developing a redundant portal. NCTA also advocates for the use of the preexisting portal, noting that the portal “works well for service providers.” The Commission agrees with commenters' analysis and thus requires carriers to submit their breach notifications to the Commission and other Federal law enforcement agencies through the existing portal. The Commission disagrees with John Staurulakis' suggestion that the Commission should instead require carriers to maintain a summary of inadvertent breaches for inclusion in their annual CPNI certification. The Commission finds that this approach would significantly delay notification of such breaches to Federal agencies, preventing law enforcement from acting quickly to investigate inadvertent breaches that may have widespread, harmful impact on customers.</P>

                        41. The Commission adopts a harm-based trigger for notification of breaches to customers so that they may focus their time, effort, and financial resources on the most important and potentially harmful incidents. The Commission agrees with commenters that adopting a harm-based trigger serves the public interest by protecting customers from over-notification and notice fatigue, specifically in instances where the carrier has reasonably determined that no harm is likely to occur. As the Commission recognized in the 
                        <E T="03">Data Breach Notice,</E>
                         it is not only distressing, but time consuming and expensive, to deal with a data breach, costing customers time, effort, and financial difficulty to change their passwords, purchase fraud alerts or credit monitoring, and freeze their credit in instances where the breach is not reasonably likely to result in any harm. Therefore the Commission finds that adopting a harm-based notification trigger, along with the expanded definition of breach, will ensure that customers are made aware of potentially harmful instances of breach, whether intentional or not, while preventing unnecessary financial and emotional difficulty in no-harm situations. The Commission agrees with those commenters that argue that the risk of notice fatigue to customers is important in light of its decision to expand the definition of breach. The Commission's adoption of the harm-based notification trigger will ensure that customer notification is focused on the incidents which are likely to cause harm, whether the incident was the result of intentional or inadvertent conduct. A harm-based trigger for notification to customers also allows carriers, particularly small and rural providers, to focus their resources on data security and mitigating any harms caused by breaches rather than generating notifications where harm was unlikely. The Commission's decision to adopt a harm-based notification trigger is also consistent with the majority of State laws, which generally do not require covered entities to notify customers of breaches when a determination is made that the breach is unlikely to result in harm.

                        42. While the record overwhelmingly supports the adoption of a harm-based notification trigger, some commenters worry that such a framework could result in legal ambiguity or lead to underreporting of breaches. The Commission takes several actions to mitigate these concerns. First, the Commission clarifies that where a carrier is unable to make a reasonable determination of whether or not harm to customers is likely, the obligation to notify customers remains. In making this determination, the Commission does not require carriers to consult Federal law enforcement or the Commission, as suggested by some commenters. Rather, carriers must determine using the factors outlined below whether harm to customers is likely to occur. If a provider concludes that harm to customers was unlikely and therefore customer notification was not required, but the Commission finds that conclusion to be unreasonable, the Commission will notify the provider. Stated differently, the Commission establishes a rebuttable presumption of harm and require carriers to notify customers of a breach in situations where the carrier is unable to reasonably determine that harm is reasonably unlikely to occur. ACA Connects argues that the Commission should decline to establish a rebuttable presumption of consumer harm because having to make filings in the interest of overcoming such a presumption would be burdensome for small providers. However, the Commission does not require any such filing. Rather, carriers must determine, based on the specific facts of a breach, whether consumer harm is reasonably unlikely to occur. The Commission provides further guidance to carriers on what constitutes harm to consumers below. The Commission rejects NCTA's proposal to limit the rebuttable presumption of harm to “instances where the breach involves a risk of tangible, financial harm, identity theft or theft of service.” NCTA's list is underinclusive in that it omits other harms that are significant. Nor does the record enable the Commission to readily draw a line that 
                        <PRTPAGE P="9978"/>
                        separates the risks of some harms from others. The Commission clarifies that carriers do not need to disprove the potential for each type of harm in every instance to overcome the presumption, but must rather come to a reasonable fact-specific conclusion that, when considering all of the factors as a whole, harm is unlikely to occur. Second, as discussed above, the Commission declines to adopt a harm-based trigger for notification to Federal law enforcement agencies and the Commission for breaches affecting 500 or more customers. As such, carriers are required to provide notification for 
                        <E T="03">all</E>
                         incidents which meet the expanded definition of data breach and this affected-customer threshold to Federal law enforcement agencies and to the Commission. ACA Connects comments that the harm-based trigger should apply not only to customer breach notifications, but to Federal-agency notifications as well. The Commission disagrees. As ACA Connects notes, Federal agencies are not prone to notice fatigue in the same way that consumers are. Additionally, as discussed above, notifying Federal agencies of all breaches allows the Commission and law enforcement agencies to identify patterns and potential vulnerabilities and develop expertise across the industry, thereby enabling them to respond in appropriate and targeted ways. Moreover, under the rules the Commission adopts today, breaches falling below this threshold must be compiled and reported to Federal agencies annually. The Commission believes that this will serve as a backstop to any potential underreporting to customers, as the Federal agencies will have an opportunity to act even in instances where the provider may have concluded that harm to the consumer was unlikely.

                         To the extent that a provider has evidence of actual harm to customers, notification is required and the harm-based analysis is conclusive. In instances where there is no definitive evidence of actual harm, as suggested in the

                         the Commission identifies a set of factors that telecommunications carriers should consider when evaluating whether harm to customers is reasonably likely. WISPA and ACA Connects support the Commission adopting a set of factors to help guide providers in determining whether harm to consumers is reasonably likely. The Commission believes that establishing a set of guidelines and recommendations strikes the right balance between preventing ambiguity, versus adopting a rigid definition which is too inflexible. The Commission believes that identifying these factors will promote consistency and further remedy concerns about ambiguity.

                        44. The Commission finds that “harm” to customers could include, but is not limited to: financial harm, physical harm, identity theft, theft of services, potential for blackmail, the disclosure of private facts, the disclosure of contact information for victims of abuse, and other similar types of dangers. Some parties raise administrability concerns about including harms such as “disclosure of private facts” on the theory that they are too speculative for providers. Beyond this bare assertion, these parties do not meaningfully explain what administrability problems would arise in practice. Additionally, they fail to account for the fact that providers only need make a 
                        <E T="03">reasonable</E>
                         determination of whether or not harm to customers is likely. Thus, even assuming 
                        <E T="03">arguendo</E>
                         that particular harms are challenging to evaluate in particular circumstances, a provider is not held to a standard of perfection, and any inherent challenges can be accounted for when evaluating the reasonableness of a given determination. The Commission's broad approach to the privacy harms that merit customer notice has ample legal support. First, OMB has noted that “types of harms” that individuals affected by a breach can experience have evolved: “Identity theft can result in embarrassment, inconvenience, reputational harm, emotional harm, financial loss, unfairness, and, in rare cases, risks to public safety.” While OMB was specifically describing harms arising from an identity theft, the fact that those harms go beyond financial supports the Commission's conclusion that other types of harm should be considered when assessing the risk of harm from a breach. Second, the Commission's approach finds support from case law—
                        <E T="03">e.g.,</E>
                         decisions holding that reputational harm can confer Article III standing. And third, the Commission's approach better reflects consumer expectations than a more cabined-approach to harm: Privacy harms that merit individual notice should be linked to those harms that individuals' experience, not those that carriers can most easily identify.
                    </P>
                    <P>
                        45. The Commission finds that this broader conception of harm is consistent with previous Commission precedent, and disagrees with commenters arguing that “harm” should only include the risk of identity theft or financial harm. The limited types of harm suggested by these commenters is underinclusive in that it omits other harms that are significant, particularly in the aggregate. The Commission find thats adopting such a narrow definition of harm is not only inconsistent with the Commission's longstanding approach, but also could lead to underreporting of breaches, and disregards other important and potentially costly consequences of a breach to customers. The Commission believes that a tiered approach would be unnecessarily complicated for carriers to assess the various “levels” of harm. Nevertheless, many of the factors that Blooston Rural Carriers suggests as relevant to their proposed analysis (
                        <E T="03">i.e.,</E>
                         financial harm, encryption, risk of identity theft) are consistent with the approach that the Commission adopts. While a broader definition of harm may be more difficult for carriers to apply in certain cases, the Commission believes that carriers will be fully capable of understanding when to comply with its disclosure requirements in light of the Commission's decision to adopt a rebuttable presumption of harm.

                         the Commission finds that no single factor on its own is sufficient to make a determination regarding harm to customers.

                        <E T="03">The sensitivity of the information (including in totality) which was breached.</E>
                         For example, the disclosure of a phone number is less likely to create harm than if the number of calls to that phone number, the duration of those calls, the name of the caller, the content of the conversations, and/or other layers of information is also disclosed. This contextual approach to gauging the sensitivity of customer information is consistent with the definition of PII the Commission adopts above with respect to its breach notification rules, which considers whether information is disclosed in combination with other information which inherently increases the risk associated with the disclosure. Additionally, harm is more likely if financial information or sensitive personal information was included in the breach. Commenters agree that a breach implicating financial information is likely harmful. Some data elements are always considered sensitive, such as bank account numbers and Social Security Numbers. Other data elements (
                        <E T="03">e.g.,</E>
                         Date of Birth) become sensitive when paired with another data element (
                        <E T="03">e.g.,</E>
                         name, address, or phone number). And still other data elements may be sensitive in context (
                        <E T="03">e.g.,</E>
                         data identifying a subscriber in a TRS 
                        <PRTPAGE P="9979"/>
                        program, because confirmed participation may be sufficient to reveal an individual's hearing- or speech-related disability). Consistent with the approach the Commission takes in this order, carriers must consider each element and all of the elements taken together, in context, to determine whether sensitive information was revealed in a breach. The data's potential for reuse should also be considered. For example, if a password is compromised, it is possible that the information could be reused to attack other accounts. Finally, if information is not able to be changed, it is more sensitive than information that is changeable. For example, a customer could change their password for an account, but the customer is unable to change their social security number, for instance. NCTA proposes an alternative approach under which the rebuttable presumption of harm only would apply “where specific types of data are compromised.” But the Commission's framework already factors in the sensitivity of the data as part of the overall analysis of harm. And as indicated by its guidance for evaluating harm, the Commission finds multiple considerations should be evaluated collectively to accurately gauge the likelihood of consumer harm. Thus, the Commission finds that its approach already accounts for potential differences in the risk of harm associated with specific types of data, but does so more effectively than NCTA's proposal by calling for a consideration of the broader relevant context, as well.

                         For example, if the information was widely accessible online over a long period of time, harm is more likely than if the information was only briefly accessible to a limited number of individuals. Information on a portable USB flash drive which does not require any special skill or knowledge to access is more likely to cause harm than information on a secured back-up device which is password protected. Covered data that was exposed for an extended period of time is more likely to have been accessed or used to the detriment of customers than data that was only briefly exposed.

                         As requested by a number of parties, the Commission adopts a safe harbor under which customer notification is not required where a breach solely involves encrypted data and the carrier has definitive evidence that the encryption key was not also accessed, used, or disclosed. For the purposes of this safe harbor, the Commission defines encrypted data as covered data that has been transformed through the use of an algorithmic process into a form that is unusable, unreadable, or indecipherable through a security technology or methodology generally accepted in the field of information security. The Commission agrees with commenters that the risk of harm to customers is significantly reduced when the data was encrypted, provided that the carrier has evidence that the encryption key has not been compromised. While EPIC recommends that the Commission not exempt breaches solely involving encrypted data from its breach notification rules, EPIC does nonetheless acknowledge that “a typical breach of encrypted data may present a lower risk of harm to consumers”, though “encrypted data can nevertheless be compromised if a third party obtains access to the requisite encryption keys or is able to identify and exploit an additional security vulnerability.” The Commission agrees. For those reasons, encrypted data is only exempted from the customer breach notification requirement where the carrier has definitive evidence that the encryption key was not compromised. Additionally, whether data was encrypted or not is irrelevant to the Federal-government breach notification requirement. As such, carriers are still required to report 
                        <E T="03">all</E>
                         breaches of covered data, whether that data was encrypted or not, to the Commission and law enforcement agencies. As the Commission has previously explained, data regarding breaches, even breaches with little or no risk of consumer harm, can be helpful to assist Federal agencies to determine data security vulnerabilities and threat patterns. Stated differently, encryption does not exempt an incident from the Commission's definition of breach, but rather only limits the instances where notification to a customer may be necessary. The Commission also agrees with commenters that its decision to implement a notification exception for encrypted data will incentivize and encourage the use of encryption to the benefit of the public, and further the goal of harmonization with State and other laws. Several States have established an exception for encrypted data from their breach notification requirements so long as the key has not been compromised or also breached. Additionally, in recent amendments to the Gramm-Leach-Bliley Act's Safeguards Rule, the FTC exempted encrypted data from its notification requirement. To the extent that a threat actor appears to have circumvented encryption, however, the carrier should conduct a harm-based analysis as if the data was never encrypted.

                        <E T="03">Data Breach Notice,</E>
                         the Commission requires telecommunications carriers to notify customers of covered data breaches without unreasonable delay after notification to Federal agencies. The Commission finds that the current framework, which imposes a mandatory seven business day waiting period, is out-of-step with current approaches regarding the urgency of notifying victims about breaches of their personal information, and that the public interest is better served by eliminating the waiting period and thereby increasing the speed at which customers can receive the important information contained in a notice. At the same time, the Commission recognizes the importance of law enforcement's ability to investigate a breach, and understands that in certain situations, notification of a breach may interfere with a criminal investigation or national security. Therefore, consistent with the Secret Service's request, the Commission will allow law enforcement to request an initial delay of up to 30 days in those specific circumstances where one is warranted. WISPA commented that the seven business day waiting period can be “crucial for law enforcement to effectively investigate the breach.” The Commission agrees that law enforcement requires an opportunity to investigate a breach, but does not find that a seven business day waiting period, applied to all breaches, is necessary. Under the framework that the Commission adopts today, law enforcement may request a delay when one would be useful, but in the many circumstances where a delay is not necessary, this rule will allow carriers to more promptly notify customers, 
                        <PRTPAGE P="9980"/>
                        thereby empowering them to take action to mitigate any harms.

                    <P>49. The Commission finds that the “without unreasonable delay” standard encourages carriers to promptly notify customers of covered data breaches while offering the flexibility to be responsive to the specifics of a situation. This approach is consistent with many existing data breach notification laws that require expedited notice but refrain from requiring a specific timeframe. As suggested by commenters, the “without unreasonable delay” standard could take into account factors such as the provider's size, as a small carrier may have limited resources and could require additional time to investigate a CPNI data breach than a larger carrier.</P>

                        50. In order to ensure that carriers notify customers quickly even in complex situations, the Commission requires customer notification no later than 30 days after reasonable determination of a breach. While in many circumstances, the “without unreasonable delay” standard means that the customer will be notified in less than seven business days, the Commission notes that in some circumstances, this standard may lead to a longer waiting time than the previous seven days. For that reason, the Commission adopts the 30-day back-stop in order to prevent unnecessarily long delays, even in such instances as the one described by USTelecom, where the carrier is engaged in investigations of the incident. The 30-day maximum amount of time is consistent with many existing State laws. In the 
                        <E T="03">Data Breach Notice,</E>
                         the Commission also considered adopting an “outside limit” of 45 or 60 days after discovery of a breach. However, the Commission finds that 30 days offers providers enough flexibility while recognizing the urgency of notifying customers as quickly as possible and without unnecessary delays. Some commenters request that the Commission adopt a safe-harbor for customer notification after determination or discovery of a breach. The Commission declines to adopt such a safe harbor because the Commission encourages providers to notify customers as quickly as possible in each individual instance. However, the Commission does establish a requirement that carriers notify customers no later than 30 days after reasonable determination of a breach to provide a clear outer bound to the “without unreasonable delay” standard.

                        <E T="03">Content of Customer Breach Notification.</E>
                         Consistent with its current rules, the Commission declines to adopt specific minimum categories of information required in a customer breach notification. The Commission makes clear, however, that a notification must include sufficient information so as to make a reasonable customer aware that a breach occurred on a certain date, or within a certain estimated timeframe, and that such a breach affected or may have affected that customer's data. While all 50 States, the District of Columbia, Guam, Puerto Rico, and the U.S. Virgin Islands have laws requiring private or governmental entities to notify individuals of breaches involving their personal information, not all of those entities impose minimum content requirements for those notices. The Commission agrees with NTCA that adding requirements with the potential to differ from other customer notice requirements imposed by States or otherwise may create unnecessary burdens on carriers, particularly small ones, as well as confusion among customers. The Commission also finds persuasive arguments by commenters that specifying the required content of customer notifications beyond the basic standard described above would prevent carriers from having enough flexibility to craft notifications that are more responsive to, and appropriate for, the specific facts of a breach, the customers, and the carrier involved. The Commission finds this argument particularly persuasive as it relates to small and rural carriers. Finally, imposing minimum requirements may delay a carrier's ability to timely notify customers, as it may take time to gather all of the necessary details and information even where it would be in the customer's best interest to receive notification more quickly albeit with less detail.
                    </P>
                    <P>
                        52. Instead, the Commission adopts as recommendations the following categories of information in security breach notices to customers: (1) the estimated date of the breach; (2) a description of the customer information that was used, disclosed, or accessed; (3) information on how customers, including customers with disabilities, can contact the carrier to inquire about the breach; (4) information about how to contact the Commission, FTC, and any State regulatory agencies relevant to the customer and the service; (5) if the breach creates a risk of identity theft, information about national credit reporting agencies and the steps customers can take to guard against identity theft, including any credit monitoring, credit reporting, or credit freezes the carrier is offering to affected customers; and (6) what other steps customers should take to mitigate their risk based on the specific categories of information exposed in the breach. Beyond the basic standard set by its rules, the Commission agrees with commenters that adopting 
                        <E T="03">guidance</E>
                         (rather than 
                        <E T="03">requirements</E>
                        ) fosters the goal of ensuring that the customer has access to pertinent information about a breach while affording carriers flexibility to tailor the contents of a customer notification to the specific circumstances at hand. The Commission also agrees with some commenters that carriers may not know, with certainty, the precise date of a breach. For that reason, the Commission has modified this requirement from its original proposal by suggesting the estimated date of the breach. Breaches which involve data such as a social security number, birth certificate, taxpayer identification number, bank account number, driver's license number, and other similar types of personally identifiable information unique to each person create the highest level of risk of identity theft. While breaches involving the types of data listed here should be considered to create a risk of identity theft for customers, this is not an exclusive list and should not be considered as such. There may be other types of data not listed here that, either alone or in conjunction with other data, may potentially create a risk of identity theft for customers.  
                    </P>
                    <P>53. The Commission believes that adopting recommendations will further the goals of consistently and sufficiently notifying customers of data breaches while maintaining some flexibility for carriers to tailor each notification to the specific facts and details of the breach. While some commenters such as EPIC suggest that the Commission should adopt minimum content requirements, the Commission believes that adopting recommendations furthers the same objective of “inform[ing] the consumer of the risks they face but also equip[ping] the consumer with options for immediate steps to reduce the downstream harms that may result” while also maintaining the flexibility that commenters overwhelmingly noted was important for effectively and quickly notifying customers.</P>

                        <E T="03">Method of Customer Breach Notification.</E>
                         The Commission declines to specify at this time the method of customer breach notification, and instead allows the carriers to assess for themselves how to best notify their customers of a data breach incident. Generally, carriers have pre-established methods of communicating with their customers about other important matters related to their service, such as outages 
                        <PRTPAGE P="9981"/>
                        and scheduled repairs. These methods may differ among carriers based on their size, their unique relationship with their customers, the types of customers impacted, and other factors. Therefore, the Commission finds that maintaining flexibility in the method of customer breach notification both reduces the burden on the carriers and prevents customer confusion that could arise if carriers were required to provide disclosures in a way that differed from how customers were used to receiving important information from their carriers.
                    </P>
                    <HD SOURCE="HD2">D. TRS Breach Reporting</HD>
                    <P>55. In 2013, the Commission adopted privacy rules applicable to telecommunications relay services (TRS) providers, to protect the CPNI of TRS users. In doing so, the Commission found that “for TRS to be functionally equivalent to voice telephone services, consumers with disabilities who use TRS are entitled to have the same assurances of privacy as do consumers without disabilities for voice telephone services.” The privacy rules for TRS include a breach notification rule that is equivalent to section 64.2011 in terms of the substantive protection afforded to TRS users.</P>
                    <P>56. To maintain functional equivalency, the Commission amends section 64.5111 so that it continues to provide equivalent privacy protection for TRS users in line with its amendments to section 64.2011. Thus, in this Order the Commission applies its breach notification and reporting obligations for TRS providers to covered data, including PII and CPNI. The Commission also expands the definition of “breach” in section 64.5111 to include inadvertent access, use, or disclosure of customer information, except in those cases where such information is acquired in good faith by an employee or agent of a TRS provider, and such information is not used improperly or further disclosed. The Commission also requires TRS providers to notify the Commission, in addition to the Secret Service and FBI, as soon as practicable, and in no event later than seven business days, after reasonable determination of a breach, except in cases where a breach affects fewer than 500 individuals, and a provider can reasonably determine that no harm to customers is reasonably likely to occur as a result of the breach. As with the Commission's breach reporting rules for telecommunications carriers, where a TRS provider is unable to reasonably determine that no harm to consumers is reasonably likely to occur as a result of the breach, it must promptly notify the relevant Federal agencies regardless of the size of the breach. Any breach affecting fewer than 500 individuals where there is no reasonable likelihood of harm to customers must be reported simultaneously to the Commission, Secret Service, and FBI in a single, consolidated annual filing. The Commission further revises its rules to require TRS providers to report breaches to the Commission, Secret Service, and FBI contemporaneously via the existing centralized portal that providers already use and with which they are familiar. In terms of the content of such notifications, the Commission mandates that notifications to the Commission, Secret Service, and FBI must, at a minimum, include: TRS provider address and contact information; a description of the breach incident; a description of the customer information that was used, disclosed, or accessed; the method of compromise; the date range of the incident and approximate number of customers affected; an estimate of the financial loss to providers and customers, if any; and the types of data breached. More specifically, the Commission clarifies that, if any data, whether partial or complete, on the contents of conversations is compromised as part of a breach—such as call transcripts—the compromise must be disclosed as part of the notification to the Commission, Secret Service, and FBI.</P>
                    <P>57. Regarding breach notifications furnished to TRS users, the Commission introduces a harm-based trigger and eliminate the requirement to notify TRS users of a breach in those instances where a TRS provider can reasonably determine that no harm to TRS users is reasonably likely to occur as a result of the breach. The Commission further revises its rules to eliminate the mandatory seven business day waiting period to notify TRS users and instead require TRS providers to notify TRS users of breaches without unreasonable delay after notification to law enforcement, and in no case later than 30 days after reasonable determination of a breach, unless law enforcement requests a longer delay. The Commission also recommends minimum categories of information for inclusion in TRS user notifications. Notifications shall be provided in formats that are accessible to individuals with disabilities.</P>
                    <P>58. As with its revisions to section 64.2011, the Commission finds that these changes will best protect and inform TRS users without resulting in overreporting or excessively burdening TRS providers or Federal agencies. These changes to Commission rules will also allow the Commission and its law enforcement partners to receive the information they require in a timely manner so that they can mitigate the harm and fallout of breaches while also taking action to deter future breaches.</P>
                    <HD SOURCE="HD3">1. Defining “Breach”</HD>
                    <P>59. In this section, the Commission applies its breach notification and reporting obligations for TRS providers to covered data, including PII and CPNI. The Commission also takes the opportunity to emphasize that covered data under the TRS data breach notification rule includes call content given the unique concerns that arise with respect to call content in the TRS context. And, the Commission expands the definition of “breach” in section 64.5111 to include inadvertent access, use, or disclosure of customer information, except in those cases where such information is acquired in good faith by an employee or agent of a TRS provider, and such information is not used improperly or further disclosed.</P>

                        <E T="03">Covered Data.</E>
                         Consistent with the provisions the Commission adopts above for carriers, the Commission applies its breach notification and reporting obligations for TRS providers to covered data, including PII and CPNI. The Commission does so for the reasons discussed above with respect to its breach notification and reporting obligations for carriers. In addition, as discussed below, section 225 of the Act directs the Commission to ensure that TRS are available to enable communication in a manner that is functionally equivalent to voice telephone services. The Commission has found that applying the privacy protections of the Commission's regulations to TRS users advances the functional equivalency of TRS. In order to ensure the functional equivalency of TRS, and to ensure that TRS users enjoy the same protections as customers of telecommunications carriers and interconnected VoIP providers, the Commission applies its TRS data breach obligations to the same scope of customer information, including both PII and CPNI. The Commission also incorporates, by reference, the scope of covered PII adopted above, for the same reasons as discussed above.
                    </P>
                    <P>
                        61. The Commission disagrees with Hamilton Relay that the “assurances of privacy” that TRS users can expect “are limited to CPNI and should not be extended to other elements of personal information, including sensitive personal information.” In the 
                        <E T="03">Data Breach Notice,</E>
                         the Commission 
                        <PRTPAGE P="9982"/>
                        recognized that providers possess proprietary information of customers other than CPNI, which customers have an interest in protecting from public exposure. This interest is particularly acute in the case of TRS users. TRS providers have access to the contents of customers' conversations, and, as AARO notes, any potential disclosure of TRS conversation content is a “grave privacy concern.” While section 225 and the Commission's TRS rules generally prohibit TRS providers from disclosing the content of any relayed conversation and from keeping records of the content of any such conversation beyond the duration of the call, that prohibition is not sufficient to protect TRS users from risks that may arise from data breaches. For instance, if a breach were to expose transcripts of TRS calls that were in progress at the time of the breach, the breaching party could obtain conversation contents between a TRS user and medical professionals, romantic partners, family members, friends, or professional colleagues, and as such may include sensitive details, such as a user's medical history, disability status, financial situation, political views, relationship status and dynamics, and religious beliefs. The disclosure of such information could lead to serious consequences, including embarrassment, ostracization from family and friends, and extortion by the breaching party or others who have gained access to the information.  
                    </P>
                    <P>62. Indeed, information about call content is not commonly available to traditional voice service providers, and thus traditional voice service customers do not face the same privacy risks in this regard as TRS users. As a result, it is particularly important in the TRS context that the Commission emphasizes the need for breach notifications with respect to call content. CPNI, PII, and the contents of calls are non-exclusive, and potentially overlapping, categories of information. Consistent with the congressional directive that the Commission's TRS rules guard against the disclosure of call content, and to promote functional equivalence between TRS and traditional voice communications services, the Commission therefore makes explicit in the text of section 64.5111 of its rules that a breach involving call content implicates those notification requirements.</P>
                    <P>
                        63. Just as with telecommunications carriers, the Commission believes that the unauthorized exposure of sensitive personal information that the provider has received from the customer or about the customer in connection with the customer relationship (
                        <E T="03">e.g.,</E>
                         initiation, provision, or maintenance, of service) is reasonably likely to pose risk of customer harm. Accordingly, any unauthorized disclosure of such information warrants notification to the customer, the Commission, and other law enforcement. Consumers expect that they will be notified of substantial breaches that endanger their privacy, and businesses that handle sensitive personal information should expect to be obligated to report such breaches.
                    </P>
                    <P>64. The Commission further disagrees with Hamilton Relay's assertion that its privacy authority does not extend to other elements of personal information beyond CPNI, or that doing so would be inconsistent with the plain language of the Act or result in duplicative or inconsistent requirements between Commission rules and State laws. The Commission does so for the reasons discussed above, and because of the principle of functional equivalency. By ensuring that the same data breach notification requirements the Commission applies to traditional telecommunications carriers also apply to TRS providers, the Commission advances the interest of ensuring that consumers can have the same expectations regarding services that they view as similar. Thus, the approach the Commission adopts not only reflects the practical expectations of consumers but also honors the intention of Congress. For example, as discussed in more detail below, Congress ratified the Commission's 2007 decision to extend section 222-based privacy protections for telecommunications service customers to the customers of interconnected VoIP providers. And ensuring equivalent protections for TRS subscribers advances Congress' directive to endeavor to ensure functionally equivalent service.</P>
                    <P>65. EPIC concurs with this approach. The Commission notes that covered data would include PII that a TRS provider collects to register a customer in the TRS User Registration Database in order to provide services. In November 2021 and March 2022 orders revoking the operating authority of certain telecommunications carriers, the Commission further stated that all communications service providers have “a statutory responsibility to ensure the protection of customer information, including PII and CPNI.”</P>
                    <P>66. Because TRS providers have access to proprietary information of customers other than CPNI, and customers have an interest in protecting that information from public exposure, the Commission finds that TRS providers should be obligated to comply with the Commission's breach notification rule whenever customers' personally identifiable information is the subject of a breach, whether or not the information is CPNI.</P>
                    <P>
                        67. 
                        <E T="03">Inadvertent Access, Use, or Disclosure.</E>
                         The Commission expands the definition of “breach” in section 64.5111 to include inadvertent access, use, or disclosure of covered data, except in those cases where such information is acquired in good faith by an employee or agent of a TRS provider, and such information is not used improperly or further disclosed. Section 64.5111(e) of the Commission's rules currently defines a breach more narrowly as occurring “when a person, without authorization or exceeding authorization, has intentionally gained access to, used, or disclosed CPNI.” As noted above, this construction was adopted in response to the practice of pretexting. As discussed above, in the years since, numerous data breaches have shown that the inadvertent exposure—as much as intentional exposure—of customer information can and does result in the loss and misuse of sensitive information by scammers, phishers, and other bad actors, and can thus trigger a need to inform the affected consumers so that they can take appropriate action to protect themselves and their sensitive information. Whether a breach was intentional may not be readily apparent, and continuing to require disclosure of only intentional breaches could thus lead to underreporting. It is moreover critical that the Commission and law enforcement be made aware of any unintentional access, use, or disclosure of covered data so that the Commission can investigate and advise TRS providers on how best to avoid future breaches and so that the Commission is prepared and ready to investigate if and when any of the affected information is accessed by malicious actors. Requiring notification for accidental breaches will encourage TRS providers to adopt stronger data security practices and will help the Commission and law enforcement to better identify and address systemic network vulnerabilities, consistent with the Commission's analysis above.

                    <P>
                        68. The record in this proceeding confirms the need for the Commission to expand the definition of “breach” in section 64.5111 to include inadvertent disclosures. As AARO note in their comments, the Commission must keep pace with evolving threats to consumer privacy, and “adopt measures that can effectively counter increasingly complex and evolving breaches.” AARO further agrees with the Commission's assessment that an intentionality 
                        <PRTPAGE P="9983"/>
                        requirement would lead to legal ambiguity and underreporting. According to AARO and EPIC, the industry will “continue to witness breaches unless companies that operate in this area” are required or incentivized to “make proper investments in their `staff and procedures to safeguard the consumer data with which they have been entrusted.' ” The Commission agrees with these commenters that expanding the definition of “breach” in section 64.5111 to include inadvertent access, use, or disclosure of covered data will help provide this incentive. The only two commenters who opposed expanding the Commission's definition of “breach” in section 64.5111 to include inadvertent disclosures of customer information were Hamilton Relay and Sorenson, and both modified their opposition to state that they only opposed such an expansion

                         accompanied by the introduction of a harm-based trigger for data breach notification. As the Commission adopts a harm-based trigger for data breach notifications to consumers below, there is no need to address these two comments further.

                         While the Commission expands the definition of “breach” in section 64.5111 to include inadvertent access, use, or disclosure of covered data, consistent with its approach to the carrier data breach rule, the Commission carves out an exception for a good-faith acquisition of covered data by an employee or agent of a TRS provider where such information is not used improperly or further disclosed. No commenters opposed this amendment to the Commission's rules for TRS providers. The Commission rejected more general criticisms of such a rule above. With only a handful of exceptions, the vast majority of State statutes include a similar provision excluding from the definition of “breach” a good-faith acquisition of covered data by an employee or agent of a company where such information is not improperly used or disclosed further, and the Commission sees no reason not to include such an exception in the TRS rule. This good-faith exception will help reduce overreporting and, by extension, will avoid worrying consumers unnecessarily.

Where a breach affects fewer than 500 individuals and the TRS provider reasonably determines that no harm to customers is reasonably likely to occur as a result of the breach, the Commission requires that providers report such breaches annually to the Commission, Secret Service, and FBI in a single, consolidated annual filing.

                         The Commission requires TRS providers to notify the Commission, in addition to the Secret Service, and the FBI, of breaches through the central reporting facility. The Commission will maintain a link to the reporting facility at 
                        <E T="03">http://www.fcc.gov/eb/cpni</E>
                         or a successor URL designated by the Bureau. This requirement is consistent with other Federal sector-specific laws, including HIPAA and the Health Breach Notification Rule, which require prompt notification to the Department of Health and Human Services (HHS) and the Federal Trade Commission (FTC), respectively.
                    </P>
                    <P>72. As the Commission found when it adopted the current data breach rules, notifying law enforcement of breaches is consistent with the goal of protecting customers' personal data because it enables such agencies to investigate the breach, “which could result in legal action against the perpetrators,” thus ensuring that they do not continue to breach sensitive customer information. The Commission also anticipated that law enforcement investigations into how breaches occurred would enable law enforcement to advise providers and the Commission to take steps to anticipate and prevent future breaches of a similar nature. While this reasoning remains sound, in the years since the Commission's rules were adopted it has become apparent that large-scale security breaches need not be purposeful in order to be harmful. As discussed above, breaches that occur as a result of lax or inadequate data security practices and employee training can be just as devastating as those perpetrated by malicious actors. Notification to the Commission of breaches, including inadvertent breaches, will provide Commission staff with critical information regarding data security vulnerabilities, and will help to shed light on TRS providers' ongoing compliance with the Commission's data breach rules.</P>
                    <P>73. The record in this proceeding supports requiring TRS providers to notify the Commission, the Secret Service, and the FBI of breaches. EPIC agrees that a breach impacting TRS users requires notification to the Commission in addition to the impacted user(s), and no commenter opposed amending the Commission's rules to require notification to the Commission concurrently with the Secret Service and FBI in the specific context of TRS.

                         The Commission requires providers to inform Federal agencies, via the central reporting facility, of all breaches, regardless of the number of customers affected or whether there is a reasonable risk of harm to customers. For breaches that affect 500 or more customers, or for which a TRS provider cannot determine how many customers are affected, the Commission requires providers to file individual, per-breach notifications as soon as practicable, but no later than seven business days after reasonable determination of a breach. As the Commission describes below, these notifications must include detailed information regarding the nature of the breach and its impact on affected customers. This same type of notification, and the seven business day timeframe for submission, will also be required in instances where the TRS provider has conclusively determined that a breach affects fewer than 500 customers unless the provider can reasonably determine that no harm to customers is reasonably likely to occur as a result of the breach.
                    </P>
                    <P>
                        75. For breaches in which a TRS provider can reasonably determine that a breach affecting fewer than 500 customers is not reasonably likely to harm those customers, the Commission requires the provider to file an annual summary of such breaches with the Commission, Secret Service, and FBI via the central reporting facility, instead of a notification. TRS providers must submit, via the existing central reporting facility and no later than February 1, a consolidated summary of breaches that occurred over the course of the previous calendar year which affected fewer than 500 customers, and where the provider 
                        <PRTPAGE P="9984"/>
                        could reasonably determine that no harm to customers was reasonably likely to occur as a result of the breach. To ensure that TRS providers may be held accountable regarding their determinations of a breach's likelihood of harm and number of affected customers, the Commission requires providers to keep records of the bases of those determinations for two years. The Commission also notes that TRS providers may voluntarily file notification of such a breach in addition to, but not in place of, this annual summary filing. In circumstances where a TRS provider initially determines that contemporaneous breach notification to Federal agencies is not required under these provisions, but later discovers information that would require such notice, the Commission clarifies that a TRS provider must report the breach to Federal agencies as soon as practicable, but no later than seven business days after their discovery of this new information. The Commission delegates authority to the Bureau to coordinate with the Secret Service regarding any modification to the portal that may be necessary to permit the filing of this annual summary. The Commission also delegates authority to the Bureau, working in conjunction with the Public Safety and Homeland Security Bureau and the Disability Rights Office, and based on the record of this proceeding—or any additional notice and comment that might be warranted—to determine the content and format requirements of this filing and directs the Bureau to release a public notice announcing these requirements. As above with respect to carriers, the Commission instructs the Bureau to minimize the burdens on TRS providers by, for example, limiting the content required for each reported breach to that absolutely necessary to identify patterns or gaps that require further Commission inquiry. At a minimum, the Bureau should develop requirements that are less burdensome than what is required for individual breach submissions to the reporting facility, and consider streamlined ways for filers to report this summary information. The first annual report will be due the first February 1 after the Office of Management and Budget (OMB) approves the annual reporting requirement under the Paperwork Reduction Act. The first report should cover all breaches between the effective date of the annual reporting requirement and the remainder of the calendar year.

                    <P>
                        76. As the Commission determined above, this reporting threshold will enable the Commission to receive more granular information regarding larger breaches to aid its investigations while also being able to study trends in breach activity through reporting of smaller breaches in annual submissions. Such a reporting threshold is also consistent with many State statutes that require notice of breaches to State law enforcement authorities. Moreover, given the Commission's expansion of the definition of “breach” in today's Order to include inadvertent exposure of CPNI and other types of data, allowing TRS providers to file information regarding certain smaller breaches in a summary format on an annual basis will tailor administrative burdens on TRS providers to reflect those scenarios where reporting is most critical. At the same time, requiring TRS providers to report breaches that fall below the threshold in a single, consolidated annual filing will continue to enable the Commission and its Federal law enforcement partners to investigate, remediate, and deter smaller breaches. The Commission notes that no commenter addressed this potential amendment to its rule for TRS providers in response to the 
                        <E T="03">Data Breach Notice,</E>
                         and addresses more general comments in this regard in Section III.B.2, above. As above, in circumstances where a TRS provider initially determines that contemporaneous breach notification to Federal agencies is not required under these provisions, but later discovers information that would require such notice, the Commission clarifies that the TRS provider must report the breach to Federal agencies as soon as practicable, but no later than within seven business days of their discovery of this new information.
                    </P>
                    <P>77. The Commission applies this threshold trigger only to notifications to Federal agencies, and not to customer notifications. Breaches affecting even just a few customers can pose just as much risk to those customers as could breaches with wider impact. For this reason, as discussed above, the Commission continues to require TRS providers to notify Federal agencies within seven business days of breaches that implicate a reasonable risk of customer harm, regardless of the number of customers affected. Doing so will permit Federal agencies to investigate smaller breaches where there is a risk of customer harm, and also allow law enforcement agencies to request customer notification delays where such notice would “impede or compromise an ongoing or potential criminal investigation or national security,” as specified in the Commission's rules.  </P>

                        <E T="03">Timeframe.</E>
                         The Commission retains its existing rule and require TRS providers to notify the Commission of a reportable breach contemporaneously with the Secret Service and FBI, as soon as practicable, and in no event later than seven business days, after reasonable determination of a breach. While the Commission proposed eliminating the seven business day deadline in the 
                        <E T="03">Data Breach Notice,</E>
                         the record received convinced the Commission that it should instead retain the more definite timeframe. The Commission agrees with AARO that the earlier TRS users are notified of breaches, the more time they will have to take actions to reduce the extent of the potential damage, and that eliminating the seven business day deadline would potentially extend the period between a breach and notification far beyond the current deadline, thus “leaving consumers unable to remediate harms.” The Commission finds that retaining the seven business day deadline properly balances the need to afford TRS providers sufficient time to conduct remediation efforts prior to submitting notifications with the need to ensure that customers receive timely notifications regarding breaches affecting their data. There is insufficient evidence that the current timeline is inadequate to accomplish the Commission's goals, and requiring breaches to be reported “as soon as practicable” without a definite timeframe could potentially be interpreted differently by different TRS providers or even by law enforcement and the Commission, thereby placing TRS providers at risk of inadvertently violating the Commission's rules should they construct “as soon as practicable” to mean something different than the Commission.
                    </P>
                    <P>79. The Commission does not believe it is necessary to shorten the existing timeframe of seven business days. As Sorenson notes, businesses with any internet presence “must routinely investigate large numbers of potential security events,” and find that a shorter deadline would put tremendous pressure on providers to report all potential security incidents before having time to determine whether a breach is reasonably likely to have occurred. Such a result would distract providers from investigating and correcting any incident that may have occurred. As Sorenson notes, the current reporting timeline of seven business days allows providers a reasonable opportunity to investigate potential incidents and determine whether a breach is reasonably likely to have occurred.</P>
                    <P>
                        80. The Commission disagrees with Hamilton Relay that the rigid structure 
                        <PRTPAGE P="9985"/>
                        in its current rules is “out of step” with other data breach notification obligations and “does not provide TRS providers with sufficient flexibility to address the different circumstances that surround data breaches.” To begin, numerous States as well as HIPAA, the Health Breach Notification Rule, and CIRCIA impose a specific time limit on when breach notifications must be made to the State or relevant Federal agency. Furthermore, there is nothing in the record beyond Hamilton Relay's unsupported assertion to indicate that TRS providers find the current seven day business deadline to be unduly burdensome or inflexible. Indeed, Sorenson advocates in favor of retaining the current seven business day deadline. Even if the Commission were to assume the seven business day deadline to be a more burdensome or inflexible standard than a more open-ended standard, the Commission still finds that the countervailing interest in ensuring customers are notified quickly of breaches affecting them outweighs this hypothetical burden. As above, the Commission clarifies that a reasonable determination that a breach has occurred does not mean reaching a conclusion regarding every fact surrounding a data security incident that may constitute a breach. Rather, a TRS provider will be treated as having “reasonabl[y] determin[ed]” that a breach has occurred when the provider has information indicating that it is more likely than not that there was a breach.

                        <E T="03">Content of Notification.</E>
                         As currently structured, the existing central reporting facility requires TRS providers to report: information relevant to a breach, including TRS provider address and contact information; a description of the breach incident; the method of compromise; the date range of the incident and approximate number of customers affected; an estimate of the financial loss to providers and customers, if any; and the types of data breached. The record supports the imposition of minimum content requirements for breach notifications to the Commission, Secret Service, and FBI. Of the commenters who addressed this issue, only Hamilton Relay opposes minimum content requirements for TRS providers, and as their comments pertain specifically to the content of breach notifications to 
                        <E T="03">customers,</E>
                         the Commission addresses them below.

                    <P>
                        82. While the Commission finds that these existing content requirements are largely sufficient, it agrees with AARO that the nature of TRS and the sensitive information involved warrants more granular clarification regarding the required disclosures as part of notifications in that context. As AARO notes, TRS users face privacy risks that voice telephone service users do not face because TRS providers and their commercial partners collect particularly sensitive data about TRS users that could be accessed in a data breach. In particular, TRS providers and their partners have direct access to call audio, transcripts, and other data on the contents of TRS users' conversations. Given this, the Commission finds that providers must include a description of the customer information that was used, disclosed, or accessed as part of their notification, including whether data on the contents of conversations, such as call transcripts, are compromised as part of a breach. The Commission notes that the actual call audio or transcripts themselves 
                        <E T="03">should not</E>
                         be disclosed as part of the notification, as doing so would be a violation of the Commission's rules. Because of the unique nature of TRS technology, which often result in the creation of transcripts or similar artifacts, the Commission finds that clarifying these additional details of the disclosures will better protect consumers and better enable the Commission and its Federal law enforcement partners to investigate, remediate, and deter breaches.

                        <E T="03">Method of Notification.</E>
                         Under current Commission rules, TRS providers are required to notify the Secret Service and FBI “through a central reporting facility” to which the Commission maintains a link on its website. The Commission retains this requirement and revises it slightly to clarify that notifications filed through the existing central reporting facility will be transmitted to and accessible by the Disability Rights Office (DRO) of the Commission's Consumer and Governmental Affairs Bureau (CGB), in addition to the Secret Service and FBI. The Commission delegates authority to the Bureau, working in conjunction with CGB, to ensure that the central reporting facility sufficiently relays notifications to DRO. The Commission finds that retaining the existing central reporting facility, rather than creating and operating a new centralized reporting facility as contemplated in the 
                        <E T="03">Data Breach Notice,</E>
                         will be the simplest and most efficient approach, and will not result in the unnecessary expenditure of resources needed to build and operate a new electronic reporting facility when one already exists. It will also reduce potential provider confusion and simplify regulatory compliance by allowing providers to continue filing notifications through the existing reporting facility. The Commission notes that no commenter addressed this potential amendment to its rule governing TRS providers in response to the 
                        <E T="03">Data Breach Notice,</E>

                    <P>84. In this section, the Commission introduces a harm-based trigger and eliminates the requirement to notify customers of a breach in any instance where a TRS provider can reasonably determine that no harm to customers is reasonably likely to occur as a result of the breach. The Commission also eliminates the mandatory seven business day waiting period to notify customers and instead requires TRS providers to notify customers of breaches without unreasonable delay after notification to the Commission and law enforcement, and in no case later than 30 days after reasonable determination of the breach, unless law enforcement requests a longer delay. The Commission recommends minimum categories for information inclusion in customer notifications. The Commission declines to specify the method that notifications to customers must take, instead leaving such a determination to the discretion of TRS providers, except that such notifications must be accessible to TRS users.  </P>

                        <E T="03">Harm-Based Notification Trigger.</E>
                         The Commission's current TRS data breach rule requires notification to customers in every instance where a breach of their information has occurred, regardless of the risk of harm. The Commission modifies that standard and foregoes the requirement to notify customers of a breach in those instances where a TRS provider can reasonably determine that no harm to customers is reasonably likely to occur as a result of the breach. In order to ensure the functional equivalency of TRS, and to ensure that TRS users enjoy the same protections as customers of telecommunications carriers and interconnected VoIP providers, the Commission adopts here the same definition of “harm” as that adopted above in the context of telecommunications carriers, for the reasons stated above.
                    </P>
                    <P>
                        86. In determining whether “harm” is likely to occur, providers should consider all the factors enumerated in the Commission's discussion above. In situations where call content—including call audio, transcripts, or other data on the contents of TRS users' 
                        <PRTPAGE P="9986"/>
                        conversations—has been or has the potential to be disclosed as a result of a breach, a TRS provider must assume that harm has or is reasonably likely to occur, and the obligation to notify customers of a breach would remain. As with the rules the Commission adopts for telecommunications services above, where a TRS provider is unable to make a determination regarding harm, the obligation to notify customers of a breach would remain. For the reasons discussed above, and in order to ensure functional equivalency for TRS users, the Commission also adopts a safe harbor under which customer notification is not required where a breach solely involves encrypted data and the TRS provider has definitive evidence that the encryption key was not also accessed, used, or disclosed. To the extent that a threat actor appears to have circumvented encryption, however, the TRS provider should conduct a harm-based analysis as if the data was never encrypted.
                    </P>
                    <P>87. The Commission finds that introducing a harm-based trigger for notifications to customers of TRS data breaches will benefit customers by avoiding confusion and “notice fatigue” with respect to breaches that are unlikely to cause harm. Given that it is not only emotionally distressing, but also time consuming and expensive to deal with the fallout of a data breach, the Commission believes that introducing a harm-based trigger will spare customers the time, effort, and financial strain of changing their passwords, purchasing fraud alerts or credit monitoring, and freezing their credit in the wake of any breach that is not reasonably likely to result in harm. A harm-based notification trigger also has a basis in the data breach notification frameworks employed by States, many of which do not require covered entities to notify customers of breaches when a determination has been made that the breach is unlikely to cause harm.</P>
                    <P>88. The Commission finds further that employing a harm-based notification trigger will not only benefit customers, but also assist TRS providers by allowing them to better focus their resources on improving data security and ameliorating the harms caused by data breaches rather than providing notifications to customers in instances where harm is unlikely to occur. Nor will the introduction of a harm-based trigger overburden providers by saddling them with the task of determining whether particular breaches are reasonably likely to cause harm. By making the standard for notification a rebuttable presumption of harm, providers must assume that harm is reasonably likely to occur as a result of a breach except where they can reasonably determine otherwise.</P>
                    <P>89. When determining whether a breach is reasonably likely to result in harm, TRS providers should consider the same factors laid out in the discussion above. In addition, in situations where call content—including call audio, transcripts, or other data on the contents of TRS users' conversations—has been or has the potential to be disclosed as a result of a breach, a TRS provider must assume that harm has or is reasonably likely to occur, and the obligation to notify customers of a breach would remain. TRS providers must construe “harm” in this context broadly. Even in those instances where no harm to customers is reasonably likely to occur, and thus the requirement to notify customers of a data breach is not triggered, TRS providers must still notify the Commission, Secret Service, and FBI of any such breach affecting 500 or more customers as soon as practicable and in any event no later than seven business days after reasonable determination of the breach via the central reporting facility. In the case of such breaches affecting fewer than 500 customers, they must be reported annually in a single, consolidated filing to the Commission, Secret Service, and FBI. While a harm-based trigger will help reduce customer notice fatigue and spare customers the time, effort, and financial strain of dealing with the fallout of a breach that is not reasonably likely to result in harm, the Commission and its law enforcement partners can still garner critical information regarding data security vulnerabilities by analyzing larger breaches, even those that are not reasonably likely to result in harm to customers.</P>
                    <P>
                        90. The record generally supports the adoption of a harm-based trigger for TRS consumer breach notifications. AARO, however, argues that “harm-based triggers should not be used in the context of TRS breach reporting to customers . . . because of the inherent privacy risks faced by TRS users.” AARO goes on to argue that, because TRS involves the collection of data on the content of a user's conversation, the Commission should presume that any data breach of a TRS provider is harmful and require the disclosure of that breach to customers and law enforcement. While the Commission agrees that the Commission and law enforcement should be apprised of all breaches, it disagrees that customers must be made aware of breaches where no harm to customers is reasonably likely to result. While the Commission agrees that TRS users face heightened privacy risks because of the nature of the technology involved, such risk alone does not justify a requirement that customers receive notification of breaches in instances where a provider can reasonably determine that no harm to customers is reasonably likely to occur as a result of the breach. TRS providers can and 
                        <E T="03">must</E>
                         take the heightened risks inherent to TRS users into account when determining whether harm is likely to result in the wake of a breach, and the Commission reiterates that providers must assume, in every case, that harm is reasonably likely to occur as a result of a breach 
                        <E T="03">except</E>
                         where they can reasonably determine otherwise. Moreover, the Commission reiterates that, in situations where call content—including call audio, transcripts, or other data on the contents of TRS users' conversations—has been or has the potential to be disclosed as a result of a breach, a TRS provider must assume that harm has or is reasonably likely to occur, and the obligation to notify customers of a breach would remain. The Commission agrees with AARO that, given the sensitive data at stake, “it is conceivable that a TRS user would want to be aware of a data breach, even if the harm of that breach is not fully determined, so that they can take remedial measures,” which is why the Commission imposes a rebuttable presumption of harm that requires notification in cases where the harm of a breach cannot be fully determined, or where call content has been or has the potential to be disclosed. The Commission finds that imposing a rebuttable presumption of harm, and requiring TRS providers to consider the heightened privacy risks experienced by TRS users when attempting to rebut this presumption, sufficiently addresses AARO's concerns without the need for mandatory consumer notifications that may result in notice fatigue and obligate consumers to expend time, effort, and resources dealing with the fallout of breaches that are not reasonably likely to result in harm.

                    <P>
                        91. The Commission agrees with Sorenson that, without a harm-based trigger, these rules could result in over-notification regarding non-critical security events without any corresponding benefit to consumers. The Commission also agrees with Hamilton Relay that such over-notification could very well result in notice fatigue and consumer indifference, which would perversely cause consumers to ignore or discount notifications, leading to failure to take 
                        <PRTPAGE P="9987"/>
                        action even in those instances where a breach is substantially likely to result in harm, and thus eliminating the main benefit of requiring consumer notifications. The Commission therefore concludes that a harm-based trigger strikes the correct balance between keeping TRS users adequately informed, and reducing over-notification and notice fatigue while reducing the attendant burdens on TRS providers.
                    </P>
                    <P>92. The Commission disagrees with EPIC that a harm-based trigger will lead to “legal ambiguity and underreporting,” or that it will delay reporting “as it may take time to assess whether the minimum threshold for reportable harm has been met.” By adopting a rebuttable presumption of harm and requiring consumer notification except in those instances where a provider can reasonably determine that no harm to customers is reasonably likely to occur, the Commission does not think that underreporting is a likely risk, as customers will still be made aware of breaches where protective action from the consumer is required. While the Commission does not here include a specific definition of how or under what circumstances this presumption may be rebutted—finding that such an approach would be too prescriptive—the Commission nevertheless provides guidance for evaluating customer harm, as outlined above. And, as discussed below, the rules require notification to customers without unreasonable delay after notification to law enforcement, and in no case later than 30 days after reasonable determination of a breach unless law enforcement requests a longer delay.  </P>

                        <E T="03">Notifying Customers of Data Breaches Without Unreasonable Delay.</E>
                         The Commission's current TRS data breach rule prohibits TRS providers from notifying customers or disclosing a breach to the public until at least seven full business days after notification to the Secret Service and FBI. The Commission eliminates this mandatory waiting period and instead requires TRS providers to notify customers of CPNI breaches without unreasonable delay after notification to law enforcement, and in no case later than 30 days after reasonable determination of a breach, unless law enforcement requests a longer delay.
                    </P>
                    <P>94. In adopting the current rule, the Commission concluded that once customers have been notified of a breach, it becomes public knowledge, “thereby impeding law enforcement's ability to investigate the breach, identify the perpetrators, and determine how the breach occurred.” The Commission found that “immediate customer notification may compromise all the benefits of requiring carriers to notify law enforcement of CPNI breaches,” and that a short delay was thus warranted.</P>
                    <P>95. As discussed above, given the sheer volume of personal data at risk, and the proliferation of malicious schemes designed to exploit that data, the Commission finds that the need to notify victims of breaches as soon as possible has grown exponentially in the years since these rules were adopted. The rules adopted in this Order will better serve the public interest by increasing the speed at which customers may receive the important information contained in a notification, except in those circumstances when law enforcement specifically requests otherwise. The Commission finds that a requirement to notify customers of data breaches without unreasonable delay after discovery of a breach and notification to law enforcement appropriately balances legitimate law enforcement needs with customers' need to take swift action to protect their information in the wake of a breach.</P>
                    <P>96. The revised rule is consistent with many existing data breach notification laws that require expedited notice but refrain from requiring a specific timeframe. While requiring notification to customers without unreasonable delay will increase the speed at which customers receive important information related to a breach, the Commission declines to adopt a specific timeframe, and finds that such an approach would be overly prescriptive. Because each data breach is different, providers must be given sufficient latitude to address each breach separately, in the manner best befitting the nature of the breach. Even so, the Commission finds it appropriate to impose an outside limit on when customers must be notified of a breach. Requiring providers to notify customers no later than 30 days after reasonable determination of a breach, unless a longer delay is requested by law enforcement, will allow TRS providers sufficient flexibility to deal with each breach on an individual basis while simultaneously installing a backstop to ensure that customers are not made unaware of a breach indefinitely.  </P>
                    <P>97. This approach is generally consistent with HIPAA, which requires notification to individuals “without unreasonable delay and in no case later than 60 calendar days after discovery of a breach,” as well as the Health Breach Notification Rule, which requires notification to individuals “without unreasonable delay and in no case later than 60 calendar days after the discovery of a breach of security.” Additionally, many States impose an outside limit on when customers must be notified of a breach following discovery of said breach.</P>
                    <P>98. Consistent with the Commission's current rules implementing section 222, the rule adopted here will allow law enforcement to direct a TRS provider to delay customer notification for an initial period of up to 30 days if such notification would interfere with a criminal investigation or national security. The Commission finds that in those instances where a provider reasonably decides to consult with law enforcement, a short initial delay of no longer than 30 days pending such consultation is reasonable under the “without unreasonable delay” standard the Commission adopts for customer notification. The Commission notes that HIPAA, the GLBA, and the Health Breach Notification Rule all allow for a delay of customer notification if law enforcement determines notification to customers would “impede a criminal investigation or cause damage to national security,” but only if law enforcement officials request such a delay. More specifically, both HIPAA and the Health Breach Notification Rule allow for notification delays of up to 30 days if orally requested by law enforcement. Similarly, most, if not all, States permit delays in notifying affected customers for legitimate law enforcement reasons. The Commission finds that the rule it adopts here strikes the appropriate balance between the needs of law enforcement to have sufficient time to investigate criminal activity and the needs of customers to be notified of data breaches without unreasonable delay.</P>
                    <P>
                        99. The record supports reconfiguring the Commission's rules in this manner. As Hamilton Relay notes, TRS providers require flexibility when addressing data breaches, and a standard requiring providers to notify customers of a breach as soon as practicable will allow TRS providers sufficient time to determine the nature of the incident, “including what consumer data may be implicated, if any. And the Commission agrees with Sorenson that imposing a rigid timeline on providers without offering sufficient time to investigate runs the risk of placing “tremendous pressure on providers to report all potential security incidents before having time to determine whether a breach is reasonably likely to have occurred,” and that such a result would not only overload the Commission but “also distract providers from investigating and correcting any incident that may have occurred.” The 
                        <PRTPAGE P="9988"/>
                        Commission finds that retaining the seven business day deadline for Federal-agency notifications will allow TRS providers a reasonable opportunity to investigate potential incidents, determine whether a breach is reasonably likely to have occurred, and report it to the Commission and its law enforcement partners, if necessary, while the elimination of the mandatory seven business day waiting period and imposition of a 30-day backstop will ensure that customers receive notification of any such breach in a timely fashion.
                    </P>
                    <P>100. The Commission disagrees with AARO that the timeframe revisions it makes will result in unwarranted delays of notifications to customers. On the contrary, the Commission finds that the pairing of an unreasonable delay standard with the elimination of the mandatory seven business day waiting period between notification of law enforcement and notification of customers is more likely to result in consumers receiving notice of a breach more quickly than they would under the Commission's current rule in many instances. By requiring TRS providers to issue consumer notifications without unreasonable delay, but in no case later than 30 days after a breach has been detected unless a longer delay is requested by law enforcement, the Commission believes that the revised rule balances the needs of law enforcement and TRS providers—to respond flexibly, with sufficient time to investigate data breaches—and customers—to take swift action in the wake of a breach.</P>

                        <E T="03">Content of Customer Breach Notification.</E>
                         Consistent with the Commission's current TRS data breach rule, the Commission declines to adopt specific minimum categories of information required in a customer breach notification. The Commission makes clear, however, that a notification must include sufficient information so as to make a reasonable customer aware that a breach occurred on a certain date, or within a certain estimated timeframe, and that such a breach affected or may have affected that customer's data. While all 50 States, the District of Columbia, Guam, Puerto Rico, and the U.S. Virgin Islands have laws requiring private or governmental entities to notify individuals of breaches involving their personal information, of these, less than half impose minimum content requirements on the notifications that must be transmitted to affected individuals in the wake of a data breach. As noted above regarding carriers, adding requirements with the potential to differ from such a high number of State requirements may create unnecessary burdens on small TRS providers. The Commission also finds that specifying the required content of customer notifications beyond the basic standard described above would inhibit TRS providers from having the flexibility to craft notifications that are more responsive to, and appropriate for, the specific facts of a breach, the customers, and the provider involved. A stricter standard could conflict with other customer notice requirements—thus burdening providers and potentially sowing confusion among consumers—and could delay providers' ability to timely notify their customers of a breach, since it could take time to gather all of the necessary details and information even in cases where it would be in customers' best interests to receive notification more quickly, albeit with less detail.

Instead, the Commission adopts as recommendations the following categories of information in security breach notifications to TRS customers: (1) the date of the breach; (2) a description of the customer information that was used, disclosed, or accessed; (3) whether data on the contents of conversations, such as call transcripts, was compromised as part of the breach; (4) information on how customers can contact the provider to inquire about the breach; (5) information about how to contact the Commission, FTC, and any State regulatory agencies relevant to the customer and the service; (6) if the breach creates a risk of identity theft, information about national credit reporting agencies and the steps customers can take to guard against identity theft, including any credit monitoring, credit reporting, or credit freezes the provider is offering to affected customers (Breaches which involve data such as a social security number, birth certificate, taxpayer identification number, bank account number, driver's license number, and other similar types of personally identifiable information unique to each person create the highest level of risk of identity theft. While breaches involving the types of data listed here should be considered to create a risk of identity theft for customers, this is not an exclusive list and should not be considered as such. There may be other types of data not listed here that, either alone or in conjunction with other data, may potentially create a risk of identity theft for customers.); and (7) what other steps customers should take to mitigate their risk based on the specific categories of information exposed in the breach.</P>
                    <P>103. The Commission finds that adopting recommendations for minimum consistent fields of information will further the goal of assisting customers in better understanding the circumstances and nature of a breach while retaining some flexibility for TRS providers to precisely tailor each notification, depending on the specific facts and details of each breach. The Commission agrees with Hamilton Relay that the Commission should give providers the flexibility to craft breach notifications that include relevant information in an accessible format, depending on the circumstances of each breach. While the Commission acknowledges arguments by AARO and EPIC supporting the imposition of minimum content requirements for customer breach notifications, the Commission is wary of imposing specific requirements that could conflict with many State regulations, and of attempting to impose a one-size-fits-all solution for all providers and all data breaches. Rather, the Commission finds that the seven categories of information recommended in this Order appropriately balance the goal of empowering consumers to take the necessary steps to protect themselves and their information in the wake of a data breach while simultaneously enabling TRS providers to respond flexibly to data breaches as they occur, and to issue customer notifications as swiftly as possible without the need to delay as they gather all of the information needed to satisfy a rigidly prescribed set of predetermined informational categories.</P>

                         The Commission declines to specify the form that notifications to customers must take, instead leaving such a determination to the discretion of TRS providers, except to require that such notifications be provided in a format accessible to individuals with disabilities. In this proceeding, commenters were uniform in their insistence that the method of customer breach notification be left to the discretion of providers where it is not specified in State law. As CCA notes, the “best means for reaching business customers and residential customers . . . can differ significantly, and carriers are best positioned based on their experience and contact with consumers to know customers' preferred way of receiving notifications.” CTIA argues further that mandating the manner of customer CPNI incident notifications could “reduc[e] carrier flexibility to provide the most up-to-date information to customers in fluid situations.” As

                        Hamilton Relay points out, “TRS providers do not have standard billing information for their customers because . . . most if not all TRS users do not pay for the service.” Because this lack of standard billing information may complicate notifications to such users, the Commission agrees with Hamilton Relay that the Commission should grant TRS providers the discretion to take all reasonable steps necessary to provide the required information to their customers in a “usable and readily understandable format” whenever a breach occurs. The Commission thus declines to specify the manner that accessible notifications to customers must take, and leaves such a determination to the discretion of TRS providers where the manner of customer breach notifications is not specified by applicable State law.

                         In their comments, Sorenson notes that “TRS customers must undergo intrusive identity and address verification that other voice telephone customers do not,” and that data retention requirements of TRS providers put customers who rely on these critical services at heightened risk. Sorenson thus recommends that the Commission's revised rules permit TRS providers to delete sensitive customer information, such as copies of users' driver's licenses/passports and other identity or address identifying information. Convo Communications take this recommendation a step further, advocating that the Commission not just permit but 
                        <E T="03">require</E>
                         providers to destroy identifying records regarding TRS users after a user is successfully registered in the TRS User Registration Database (TRS URD).

                    <P>106. The Commission declines to adopt these recommendations at this time. The requirements to collect and retain user registration information for registration in the TRS User Registration Database are outside the scope of this proceeding. The TRS User Registration Database is a centralized system of registration records established to protect the TRS Fund from waste, fraud, and abuse and to improve the Commission's ability to manage and oversee the TRS program. A necessary component of the administration and oversight of the TRS User Registration Database and the TRS program in general, is the ability of the Commission, the TRS User Registration Database administrator, and the TRS Fund administrator to review and audit the registration information of TRS users and the registration practices of TRS providers. Any consideration of changes to the rules concerning TRS providers retaining required registration information for TRS users must include an assessment of the impact of the ability of the Commission and relevant administrators to review the data upon which users were verified in the database. The record in this proceeding is incomplete as the Commission did not seek comment on this issue. The Commission therefore does not take action on this issue at this time.</P>

The Commission concludes further that it has authority to apply these revised rules to interconnected VoIP providers. Lastly, the Commission finds that Congress' nullification of the Commission's revisions to its data breach rules in the

                         pursuant to the Congressional Review Act (CRA) does not now preclude the Commission from adopting the rules set forth in this Order.

                    <HD SOURCE="HD3">1. Section 222</HD>
                    <P>108. Section 222 of the Act provides authority for the requirements the Commission adopts and revises today. Section 222(a) imposes a duty on carriers to “protect the confidentiality of proprietary information of, and relating to” customers, fellow carriers, and equipment manufacturers. Section 222(c) imposes more specific requirements on carriers as to the protection and confidentiality of customer proprietary network information. Both subsections independently provide the Commission authority to adopt rules requiring telecommunications carriers and interconnected VoIP providers to address breaches of customer information, but the breadth of section 222(a) provides the additional clarity that the Commission's breach reporting rules can and must apply to all PII rather than just to CPNI.</P>
                    <P>109. The Commission has long required carriers to report data breaches as part of their duty to protect the confidentiality of customers' information. The revisions to the Commission's data breach reporting rules adopted in this Order reinforce carriers' duty to protect the confidentiality of their customers' information, including information that may not fit the statutory definition of CPNI. Data breach reporting requirements also reinforce the Commission's other rules addressing the protection of customer information by meaningfully informing customer decisions regarding whether to give, withhold, or retract their approval for carriers to use or disclose their information. Moreover, requiring carriers to notify the Commission in the event of a data breach will better enable the Commission to identify and confront systemic network vulnerabilities and help investigate and advise carriers on how best to avoid future breaches, while simultaneously assisting carriers in fulfilling their duty pursuant to section 222(a) to protect the confidentiality of their customers' information.</P>
                    <P>
                        110. The Commission rejects Lincoln Network's argument that section 222 does not grant the Commission authority to adopt rules requiring telecommunications carriers and interconnected VoIP providers to address breaches of covered data. Section 222 explicitly imposes a duty on telecommunications carriers to “protect the confidentiality of proprietary information of, and relating to, other telecommunication carriers, equipment manufacturers, and customers.” To argue, as Lincoln Network does, that section 222 does not grant the Commission “clear authority to protect the security of data” contravenes the clear language and intent of section 222. Ever since it began implementation of the 1996 Act, the Commission has understood section 222(a) as a source of carriers' duties and as a source of Commission rulemaking authority. To the extent that the Commission has described its section 222 authority as coextensive with the definition of CPNI, the Commission disavows such an interpretation. In those proceedings, the Commission was not examining the distinction between CPNI and other sensitive personal information, and it never explicitly decided that section 222(a) does not reach other forms of personal information. In fact, the Commission in 2007 described section 222(a)'s duty as extending to “proprietary or personal customer information,” and more recent enforcement actions have affirmed that carriers' duty to protect customer information extends beyond CPNI. As noted below, the general interpretation of section 222 in the 
                        <E T="03">TerraCom NAL</E>
                         also was confirmed by the Commission in a subsequent rulemaking order. And as noted above, in November 2021 and March 2022 orders revoking the operating authority of certain telecommunications carriers, the Commission further stated that all communications service providers have “a statutory responsibility to ensure the protection of customer information, 
                        <PRTPAGE P="9990"/>
                        including PII and CPNI.” To find that carriers have no duty to protect the confidentiality of non-CPNI PII would be inconsistent with the plain language of section 222(a)'s use of the term “proprietary information of, and relating to, . . . customers” and is not the best interpretation of that provision. Instead, consistent with those recent Commission actions, the Commission finds that the phrase “information of, and relating to, . . . customers” in section 222(a) is naturally—and indeed best—interpreted to have the same definition as PII, subject to the additional limitation that the information be “proprietary” to the carrier—
                        <E T="03">i.e.,</E>
                         obtained in connection with establishing or maintaining a communications service. NCTA asserts that “most PII . . . is not `proprietary information,” but does not justify why the Commission should adopt an understanding of that term different than the one here. Finally, given the larger context discussed below, to the extent that an obligation to take reasonable measures to protect all PII were not derived directly from section 222(a), that would be because Congress understood it already to be based in section 201(b)'s prohibition on unjust or unreasonable practices.

                    <P>
                        111. Some commenters contend that section 222(a) simply sets out high-level principles the substantive details of which are specified elsewhere. The Commission rejects NCTA's claim that “legislative history supports an interpretation of Section 222 that does not impose an affirmative obligation under Section 222(a), which shows that Congress deliberately chose not to use ‘personally identifiable information' in Section 222.” NCTA cites a statement from the conference report that “ `the new section 222 strives to balance both competitive and consumer privacy interests with respect to CPNI.'” But as even commenters opposed to the Commissin's interpretation of section 222(a) recognize, section 222 applies to more than just CPNI, undercutting any understanding of that statement as reflecting the full scope and contours of section 222. NCTA also cites a House Report discussing earlier statutory language considered by the House, which would have specified a different scope of covered information. But that alternative definition also was part of a statutory provision that different in many other ways from section 222 as ultimately adopted, 
                        <E T="03">see</E>
                         July 24, 1995 House Rep., at 22–23, and section 222 as enacted ultimately was based on the Senate version. In sum, the Commission sees nothing in the legislative history that would persuade it to depart from what it sees as the best interpretation of section 222(a) based on the statutory text. But even beyond the foregoing analysis, that interpretation of section 222(a) is at odds with the fact that section 222(a) lists “equipment manufacturers” among the classes of entities owed confidentiality protections as part of a carrier's “general” duty. Given that section 222 never otherwise mentions confidentiality protections owed to those entities, this reinforces the Commission's view that section 222(a) is best read as imposing enforceable obligations on telecommunications carriers separate and apart from the requirements of section 222(b) and (c). Admittedly, as CTIA points out, 
                        <E T="03">see</E>
                         CTIA Comments at 12, section 273(d)(2) separately prohibits “[a]ny entity which establishes standards for telecommunications equipment or customer premises equipment, or generic network requirements for such equipment, or certifies telecommunications equipment or customer premises equipment . . . from releasing or otherwise using any proprietary information, designated as such by its owner, in its possession as a result of such activity, for any purpose other than purposes authorized in writing by the owner of such information.” But CTIA fails to demonstrate that the entities that are the focus of section 222(a)—
                        <E T="03">i.e.,</E>
                         telecommunications carriers—are fully subsumed by (or even substantially overlap with) the entities that are the focus of section 273(d)(2)—
                        <E T="03">e.g.,</E>
                         entities that establish equipment standards or requirements or certify such equipment. The significant mismatch between sections 222(a) and 273(d)(2) thus gives the Commission no reason to question its understanding of section 222(a). Nor does section 222(a) otherwise include textual indicia at odds with the Commission's understanding. Section 222(a) employs regulatory terminology in imparting a general “duty” on telecommunications carriers. Section 222(a)'s heading of “In General” also is fully compatible with the Commission's understanding of that provision as imposing a general duty—in contrast to alternative headings such as “Purpose” or “Preamble” that would indicate that the “duty” announced by such a provision is merely precatory or a “statement of purpose” with no legal force of its own.  
                    </P>
                    <P>112. Contrary to some commenters' claims, the Commission's interpretation of section 222(a) also otherwise is compatible with the remainder of section 222. The Commission reads section 222(a) as imposing a broad duty that can and must be read in harmony with the more specific mandates set forth elsewhere in the statute. This understanding of section 222(a) also accords with the fact that the Commission generally has relied on a “reasonableness” standard when evaluating carriers' protection of information under section 222. Provisions such as sections 222(b) and (c) directly impose specific requirements on telecommunications carriers to address concerns that were particularly pressing at the time of section 222's enactment, which continue to control over the more general duty in section 222(a) to the extent of any overlap. The Commission's interpretation of section 222(a) thus preserves the role of each of these provisions within the section 222 framework. And given the more detailed statutory specification of carriers' requirements regarding CPNI in section 222, it is understandable the Congress made a point of establishing express exceptions from those requirements in section 222(d). Part of interpreting section 222(a) in harmony with section 222 as a whole includes interpreting it in harmony with section 222(d). Thus, the Commission does not interpret the grounds for disclosure authorized by section 222(d) as violating carriers' obligation to protect the confidentiality of proprietary information imposed by section 222(a). The Commission's analysis is the same regarding other provisions of section 222, such as the subscriber information disclosure requirements in section 222(e) and (g). Thus, the Commission does not interpret section 222(a) to impose obligations inconsistent with those disclosure requirements, either. Because the Commission reads section 222(a) in harmony with the remainder of section 222 there is no incompatibility in its approach. And the mere omission of section 222(a) from provisions like section 222(d), (e), and (g) would have been an oblique and indirect way of dictating an interpretation of section 222(a) that runs counter to its plain meaning: a reasonable person would not interpret “a duty to protect the confidentiality” of customer information as prohibiting its use for billing, for example, as is permitted by section 222(d)(1).</P>

                        113. Lincoln Network attempts to draw a distinction between security and confidentiality that is unavailing. Lincoln Network itself appears to recognize that something that could be characterized as a “security” breach can 
                        <PRTPAGE P="9991"/>
                        result in loss of confidentiality for data or information. Thus, even assuming 
                        <E T="03">arguendo</E>
                         that breaches of security and breaches of confidentiality are not coextensive, that would matter only if the Commission were attempting to act beyond the scope of section 222's statutory grant of authority with respect to confidentiality—which is not the case here. Based on relevant textual indicia, the Commission concludes that “confidentiality” within the meaning of section 222 encompasses impermissible access to, use of, and/or disclosure of covered information. Section 222(a) establishes carriers' “duty to protect the confidentiality of proprietary information . . . .” Section 222(b), in turn, is entitled “[c]onfidentiality of carrier information,” and limits carriers' “use” of proprietary information. Section 222(c) is entitled “[c]onfidentiality of customer proprietary network information” and limits how carriers “use, disclose, or permit access to” individually identifiable CPNI. “Although section headings cannot limit the plain meaning of a statutory text, `they supply cues' as to what Congress intended.” Against that backdrop the Commission rejects Lincoln Network's attempts to rely on isolated examples of terminology uses from recent industry reports or the like. The Commission's data breach reporting requirements focus on “breaches,” which occur when “a person, without authorization or exceeding authorization, gains access to, uses, or discloses covered data.” The “covered data” is defined in terms of the statutory categories of proprietary information and customer proprietary network information, and the focus on access, use, and disclosure of those data fits comfortably within the Commission's section 222 authority.

                        114. Section 201(b) of the Act requires practices of common carriers to be just and reasonable and declares any unjust or unlawful practices to be unlawful. The Commission concluded in the 
                        <E T="03">TerraCom NAL</E>
                         that section 201(b) was violated when carriers failed to notify customers whose personal information had been breached by the carriers' inadequate data-security policies. The 
                        <E T="03">TerraCom NAL</E>
                         explicitly put carriers “on notice that in the future [the Commission] fully intend[s] to assess forfeitures for such violations” under section 201(b). As NCTA points out, the Commission did not propose a forfeiture under section 201(b), NCTA Reply at 10–11, but that was because it was the first time the Commission had declared a carrier's practices related to its failure to notify consumers of a data breach to be a violation of section 201(b). The Commission made explicit that, in the future, such violations would be penalized under section 201(b). The Commission now makes that clear again here. The Commission therefore concludes that its authority to prohibit unjust and unreasonable practices and to “prescribe such rules and regulations as may be necessary in the public interest to carry out the provisions of” the Act pursuant to section 201(b) provides independent authority for the Commission to consider PII as protected consumer information and to require carriers to notify customers, law enforcement, and the Commission about breaches as discussed throughout this Report and Order.

                    <P>
                        115. CTIA provides no explanation for its conclusory assertion that carriers' data privacy and security practices are not practices “in connection with” communications services. The Commission is no more persuaded by arguments that take a different tack and contend that the carrier actions at issue in this proceeding are not “charges,” “practices,” “classifications,” or “regulations” within the meaning of section 201(b). This argument relies on the theory that the Supreme Court has held “that activity is not covered by Section 201(b) unless it ‘
                        <E T="03">resembles</E>
                         activity that . . . transportation and communications agencies have long regulated.' ” But in that decision, the Supreme Court did not so hold; it merely considered that factor in support of its threshold determination that the activity at issue there “easily fits within the language of the statutory phrase” as understood “in ordinary English.” The Commission sees no reason why a carrier's privacy and data breach notification practices with respect to customer PII that it has by virtue of its service relationship with them would not easily fit within the ordinary understanding of that statutory phrase, as well. Independently, the Commission also observes that the Commission has, in fact, historically regulated carriers' privacy practices under its section 201(b) authority. Certainly any information collected from a customer or prospective customer related to establishing or maintaining the provision of a communications service would qualify. As discussed above, it is well established that carriers have come into possession of, and sometimes suffered breaches of, sensitive personal information that may not be CPNI. Nor does the canon of statutory construction about specific provisions governing general ones apply here. Section 222, adopted as part of the Telecommunications Act of 1996 (1996 Act), was not intended to narrow carriers' privacy duties or the Commission's authority to oversee carriers' privacy practices. The Commission rejects contrary arguments premised on the fact that section 222 does not itself include a savings clause expressly preserving the Commission's authority under section 201, in contrast to section 251 of the Act. The 1996 Act made clear that “the amendments made by this Act shall not be construed to modify, impair, or supersede Federal, State, or local law unless expressly so provided in such Act or amendments.” Nothing in section 222 expressly modifies, impairs, or supersedes the Commission's authority under section 201(b) to act to ensure that carriers' practices are just and reasonable. While it is not entirely clear why Congress felt the need for an additional savings clause in section 251(i), it might simply have done so “to be doubly sure,”

                         at 5–6. Such high-level statements in legislative history do not persuade the Commission to depart from what it sees as the best interpretation of the statutory text. Nor is it even clear that the relevant balancing of interests in the cited legislative history necessarily is relevant to the particular exercise of section 201(b) authority at issue here.

                         H.R. Rep. No. 103–559, at 60 (June 24, 1994) (discussing the “careful balance of competing, often conflicting, considerations” of consumers' need “to be sure that information about them that carriers can collect is not misused” with consumers' expectation that “the carrier's employee will have available all relevant information about their service,” which “argues for looser restrictions on internal use of customer information”). The Commission regulated carriers' privacy practices under its general Title II authority even before enactment of the 1996 Act, and the 1996 Act codified the privacy duty and enacted specific restrictions for the new competitive environment that the Act was intended to promote. In the course of rejecting a request that carriers be compelled to share customer 
                        <PRTPAGE P="9992"/>
                        information with certain other carriers to protect against discrimination against competitors under sections 201(b) and 202(a) of the Act, the Commission stated that “the specific consumer privacy and consumer choice protections established in section 222 supersede the general protections identified in sections 201(b) and 202(a).” Understood in context, that simply stands for the proposition that where consumer privacy issues addressed specifically in section 222 are implicated, the requirements of section 222 are controlling over more general protections in section 201(b) and 202(a) that are unrelated to privacy—such as advancing competitive neutrality. The Commission similarly rejects attempts to rely on statements about section 222 that the Commission made in analogous statutory contexts where it rejected pro-competition requirements under statutory provisions like sections 272 or 274 in light of the privacy requirements of section 222. More generally, to the extent that the Commission has made statements that its section 222 authority supersedes its authority under section 201(b), the Commission disavows such an interpretation for the reasons stated in this section. Independently, with particular respect to data breach notification requirements, the Commission does not find either section 201(b) or section 222 to be a more specific provision. And even assuming 
                        <E T="03">arguendo</E>
                         that section 222 were controlling within its self-described scope, the Commission's rules are fully consistent with that authority as well. As the Commission stated in 1998, “Congress . . . enacted section 222 to prevent consumer privacy protections from being inadvertently swept away along with the prior limits on competition.” For the reasons discussed throughout this Report and Order, notification to customers, law enforcement, and the Commission are essential to the Commission's oversight of carriers' privacy practices.
                    </P>
                    <P>116. The structure of the Communications Act and its relationship with the Federal Trade Commission Act also demonstrate that this Commission has authority to make rules governing common carriers' protection of PII. The FTC has broad statutory authority to protect against “unfair or deceptive” acts or practices, but that authority is limited by carving out several exceptions for categories of entities subject to oversight by other regulatory agencies, one of which is common carriers subject to the Communications Act. The clear intent is that the expert agencies in those areas will act based on the authorities provided by those agencies' statutes. It is implausible that Congress would have exempted common carriers from any obligation to protect their customers' private information that is not CPNI. Insofar as some parties contend that section 222 establishes a comprehensive scheme of privacy regulation for carriers to the exclusion of section 201(b), yet also contest the Commission's interpretation of section 222(a), they effectively ask the Commission to accept that the supposedly comprehensive privacy scheme that Congress enacted intentionally left the non-CPNI PII of carriers' customers unprotected by Federal law. As discussed, the Commission not only finds that view contrary to the statutory text, but find it implausible more generally.</P>
                    <HD SOURCE="HD3">3. Interconnected VoIP</HD>
                    <P>
                        117. The Commission finds that section 222 and the Commission's ancillary jurisdiction grant the Commission authority to apply the rules it adopts here to interconnected VoIP providers. Interconnected VoIP providers have been explicitly subject to the Commission's data breach rules since 2007, when the Commission first adopted the data breach notification rule. In the 
                        <E T="03">2007 CPNI Order,</E>
                         the Commission recognized that if interconnected VoIP services were telecommunications services, they self-evidently would be covered by section 222 and the Commission's implementing rules. Although the Commission has not broadly addressed the statutory classification of interconnected VoIP as a general matter, it has consistently recognized that a provider may offer VoIP on a Title II basis if it voluntarily “holds itself out as a telecommunications carrier and complies with appropriate Federal and State requirements.” But because the Commission generally had not classified interconnected VoIP, the Commission also exercised its Title I ancillary jurisdiction to extend its CPNI rules to interconnected VoIP services, finding that “interconnected VoIP services fall within the subject matter jurisdiction granted to [the Commission] in the Act,” and that “imposing CPNI obligations is reasonably ancillary to the effective performance of the Commission's various responsibilities.”
                    </P>
                    <P>
                        118. The Commission proceeds under the same alternative bases here, and concludes that legal and factual bases for the findings relied on in the 
                        <E T="03">2007 CPNI Order</E>
                         have only grown more persuasive since then. The Commission observed at the time that “interconnected VoIP service `is increasingly used to replace analog voice service.' ” This trend has continued. Interconnected VoIP now accounts for a far larger share of the residential fixed voice services market than legacy switched access services, and “fixed switched access continues to decline while interconnected VoIP services continue to increase.” Therefore, as the Commission found in 2007, today's consumers should reasonably expect “that their telephone calls are private irrespective of whether the call is made using the services of a wireline carrier, a wireless carrier, or an interconnected VoIP provider, given that these services, from the perspective of a customer making an ordinary telephone call, are virtually indistinguishable.” The Commission likewise thinks interconnected VoIP subscribers should reasonably expect their other information to also be protected and treated confidentially consistent with the other protections that apply under section 222. Furthermore, extending section 222's protections to interconnected VoIP service customers remains “necessary to protect the privacy of wireline or wireless customers that place calls to or receive calls from interconnected VoIP customers.” Indeed, following the 
                        <E T="03">2007 CPNI Order,</E>
                         Congress ratified the Commission's decision to apply section 222's requirements to interconnected VoIP services, adding language to section 222 that applied provisions of section 222 to users of “IP-enabled voice service.” These revisions to section 222 would not make sense if the privacy-related duties of subsections (a) and (c) did not apply to interconnected VoIP providers. The Commission notes that no commenter chose to address this issue in the course of this proceeding.

                        119. In the case of interconnected VoIP providers that have obtained direct access to telephone numbers, the Commission concludes that section 251(e) also gives the Commission authority to condition that access on those providers' compliance with privacy requirements equivalent to those that apply to telecommunications carriers. The Commission previously exercised its authority under section 251(e) to ensure, for example, that an interconnected VoIP provider receiving direct access to numbers “possesses the financial, managerial, and technical expertise to provide reliable service.” Ensuring that interconnected VoIP providers remain on the same regulatory footing as telecommunications carriers with respect to customer privacy—as was the case when direct access to numbers for interconnected VoIP providers began—will ensure a level

                    <P>
                        120. The Commission finds that it has separate and independent authority under sections 225 and 222 to amend its data breach rule for TRS to ensure that TRS users receive privacy protections equivalent to those enjoyed by users of telecommunications and VoIP services. Section 225 of the Act directs the Commission to ensure that TRS are available to enable communication in a manner that is functionally equivalent to voice telephone services. In the 
                        <E T="03">2013 VRS Reform Order,</E>
                         the Commission found that applying the privacy protections of the Commission's regulations to TRS users advances the functional equivalency of TRS. The Commission concluded further that the specific mandate of section 225 to establish “functional requirements, guidelines, and operations procedures for TRS” authorizes the Commission to make the privacy protections included in the Commission's data breach regulations applicable to TRS users.
                    </P>
                    <P>121. The Commission also found that extending its privacy—including data breach—regulations to TRS users was ancillary to its responsibilities under section 222 of the Act to telecommunications service subscribers that place calls to or receive calls from TRS users, because TRS call records include call detail information concerning all calling and called parties. The Commission moreover determined that applying data breach requirements to point-to-point video services provided by VRS providers (such point-to-point services, while provided in association with VRS, are not themselves a form of TRS) is ancillary to its responsibilities under sections 222 and 225, including the need to protect information that VRS providers had by virtue of being a given customer's registered VRS provider—even in the context of point-to-point video service—and to guard against the risk to consumers who are likely to expect the same privacy protections when dealing with VRS providers, whether they are using VRS or point-to-point video services.</P>
                    <P>
                        122. The Commission concludes that, for the same reasons cited in the 
                        <E T="03">2013 VRS Reform Order,</E>
                         these sources of authority for establishing the current data breach rule for TRS now authorize the Commission to amend this rule to ensure that TRS users continue to receive privacy protections equivalent to those enjoyed by users of telecommunications and VoIP services. The record in this proceeding supports this conclusion. As AARO states, the Commission has “ample legal authority” to amend its data breach rule for TRS under sections 222 and 225.

                        123. In 2016, the Commission attempted to revise its breach notification rules as part of a larger proceeding addressing privacy requirements for broadband internet service providers (ISPs). In 2015, the Commission classified broadband internet access service as a telecommunications service subject to Title II of the Act, a decision that the D.C. Circuit upheld in 
                        <E T="03">U.S. Telecom Ass'n</E>
                         v. 
                        <E T="03">FCC,</E>
                         825 F.3d 674 (D.C. Cir. 2016). As a result of classifying broadband internet access service as a telecommunications service, such services were subject to sections 201 and 222 of the Act. The rules the Commission adopted in the 
                        <E T="03">2016 Privacy Order</E>
                         applied to telecommunications carriers and interconnected VoIP providers in addition to ISPs, which had been classified as providers of telecommunications services in 2015. In 2017, however, Congress nullified those 2016 revisions to the Commission's privacy rules under the CRA. Pursuant to the language of the Resolution of Disapproval, the 
                        <E T="03">2016 Privacy Order</E>
                         was rendered “of no force or effect.” That resolution conformed to the procedure set out in the CRA, which requires agencies to submit most rules to Congress before they can take effect and provides a mechanism for Congress to disapprove of such rules. Pursuant to the operation of the CRA, the 
                        <E T="03">2016 Privacy Order</E>
                         “may not be reissued in substantially the same form, and a new rule that is substantially the same as such a rule may not be issued, unless the reissued or new rule is specifically authorized by a law enacted after the date of the joint resolution disapproving the original rule.”

                    <P>
                        124. In analyzing the impact of the Resolution of Disapproval of the 
                        <E T="03">2016 Privacy Order,</E>
                         the Commission first explains its understanding of the CRA's prohibition on reissuance. The Commission also shows that, in any event, the revisions made here to the breach notification rule are different in substantial ways from those that were included in the 
                        <E T="03">2016 Privacy Order.</E>
                    </P>
                    <P>
                        125. First, the Commission concludes that the CRA is best interpreted as prohibiting the Commission from reissuing the 
                        <E T="03">2016 Privacy Order</E>
                         in whole, or in substantially the same form, or from adopting another item that is substantially the same as the 
                        <E T="03">2016 Privacy Order.</E>
                         It does not prohibit the Commission from revising its breach notification rules in ways that are similar to, or even the same as, some of the revisions that were adopted in the 
                        <E T="03">2016 Privacy Order,</E>
                         unless the revisions adopted are the same, in substance, as the 
                        <E T="03">2016 Privacy Order</E>
                         as a whole. To be clear, although the CRA would permit the Commission to adopt a breach notification rule that is the same as the breach notification rule that was adopted by the 
                        <E T="03">2016 Privacy Order,</E>
                         the rule that the Commission adopts here has substantial differences. The Commission rejects arguments that there was insufficient notice for the Commission to adopt this interpretation of the effect of the CRA resolution of disapproval. In pertinent part, notice under the APA requires “reference to the legal authority under which the rule is proposed” and “either the terms or substance of the proposed rule or a description of the subjects and issues involved.” The 
                        <E T="03">Data Breach Notice</E>
                         described the proposal to adopt expanded data breach notification requirements pursuant to its statutory authority under sections 222, 225, and other possible sources of authority. In the course of this request for comment, the Commission sought specific comment regarding “the effect and scope of the Congressional disapproval of the 
                        <E T="03">2016 Privacy Order.”</E>
                         This satisfies the requirements of the APA. Even beyond that, however, the Commission's interpretation flows from ordinary tools of statutory interpretation, first and foremost by focusing on the relevant statutory text and context. Contrary to the suggestion of some, the Commission finds nothing “novel” about this interpretive approach, providing additional grounds to conclude that the notice and comment requirements of the APA were satisfied here.  
                    </P>
                    <P>
                        126. Congress's Resolution of Disapproval, by its terms, disapproved “the rule submitted by the Federal Communications Commission relating to ‘Protecting the Privacy of Customers of Broadband and Other Telecommunications Services' (81 FR 87274 (December 2, 2016)).” This referred to the 
                        <E T="03">2016 Privacy Order</E>
                         in its entirety, which was summarized in the cited 
                        <E T="04">Federal Register</E>
                         document. The statutory term “rule,” as used in the CRA, refers to “the whole or a part of an agency statement of general or particular applicability and future effect 
                        <PRTPAGE P="9994"/>
                        designed to implement, interpret, or prescribe law or policy or describing the organization, procedure, or practice requirements of an agency.” Thus, “rule” can and does refer to an entire decision that adopts rules. In implementing Congress's resolution of disapproval, the Commission treated the 
                        <E T="03">2016 Privacy Order</E>
                         as a single rule. In a ministerial order, the Commission “simply recogniz[ed] the effect of the resolution of disapproval” should be that “the 
                        <E T="03">2016 Privacy Order</E>
                         `shall be treated as though [it] had never taken effect.' ” As a result, all of the changes that the 
                        <E T="03">2016 Privacy Order</E>
                         made to the Commission rules codified in the Code of Federal Regulations were reversed, with the result that all of the Commission rules in part 64, subpart U, were restored to how they read prior to their amendment by the 
                        <E T="03">2016 Privacy Order.</E>
                         The term “rule” can also refer to parts of such a decision, or to various requirements as adopted or amended by such a decision. In the context of the CRA's bar on reissuance, the Commission must consider which rule is specified by that bar. The reissuance bar, 5 U.S.C. 801(b)(2), provides that “a new rule that is substantially the same as such a rule may not be issued”—where “such a rule” refers to the rule specified in the joint resolution of disapproval as described in section 802. As shown above, the joint resolution referred to the entirety of the 
                        <E T="03">2016 Privacy Order.</E>
                         Therefore, the Commission concludes that the “rule” to which the reissuance bar applies is the entire 
                        <E T="03">2016 Privacy Order</E>
                         with all of the rule revisions adopted therein.
                    </P>
                    <P>
                        127. The Commission concludes that it would be erroneous to construe the resolution of disapproval as applying to anything other than all of the rule revisions, as a whole, adopted as part of the 
                        <E T="03">2016 Privacy Order.</E>
                         That resolution had the effect of nullifying each and every provision of the 
                        <E T="03">2016 Privacy Order</E>
                        —each of those parts being rules under the APA—but not “the rule” specified in the resolution of disapproval. By its terms, the CRA does not prohibit the adoption of a rule that is merely substantially similar to a limited portion of the disapproved rule or one that is the same as individual pieces of the disapproved rule. The Commission rejects arguments that because the CRA borrows from the APA's definition of “rule” as referring to the whole or a part of certain agency statements of general applicability and future effect, an agency cannot adopt a rule substantially similar to any part of an agency rulemaking decision that does not take effect due to a resolution of disapproval under the CRA. The key issue is not the definition of “rule” in the abstract, but the wording of 5 U.S.C. 801(b)(2) (along with the wording of the resolution of disapproval itself). And 5 U.S.C. 801(b)(2) is worded in singular terms—referring to “
                        <E T="03">A rule</E>
                         that does not take effect (or does not continue) under paragraph (1) . . . ” as opposed to saying “
                        <E T="03">Any rule</E>
                         that does not take effect (or does not continue) under paragraph (1) . . . ” or “
                        <E T="03">Rules</E>
                         that do not take effect (or do not continue) under paragraph (1) . . . .” So even if there might be multiple APA rules that do not take effect as a result of a resolution of disapproval, the CRA's focus is on a singular “rule” that does not take effect. Since the whole 
                        <E T="03">2016 Privacy Order</E>
                         was the subject of the resolution of disapproval, and the whole 
                        <E T="03">2016 Privacy Order</E>
                         did not take effect as a result, the Commission concludes that the whole 
                        <E T="03">2016 Privacy Order</E>
                         is the relevant “rule” for purposes of 5 U.S.C. 801(b)(2). And although some commenters claim that the Commission's approach to interpreting the CRA could lead to uncertainty about what is subject to 5 U.S.C. 801(b)(2), they do not identify any actual ambiguity as the Commission's approach is applied here—instead, they seemingly just dislike the outcome. Nor is the Commission persuaded that Congress lacks the tools to address any concerns about the scope of a resolution of disapproval if any were to arise. For example, the record does not reveal why Congress could not specify the “relating to” criterion in the resolution of disapproval language required by 5 U.S.C. 802(a) in more granular or detailed ways. Independently, Congress also always remains free to enact laws outside the CRA process that reject agency rules with as much detail and precision as they wish should ambiguity concerns become a practical problem.
                    </P>
                    <P>128. To prohibit an agency from making any of the individual decisions made in an entire disapproved rulemaking action would not only be contrary to the text of the resolution of disapproval, interpreted consistently with the CRA, but also would be contrary to the apparent intent of the CRA. When Congress adopted the CRA, it recognized that it would be necessary for agencies to interpret the scope of the bar on reissuance in the future. According to a floor statement that its authors intended to be authoritative,</P>
                    <FP>[t]he authors [of the CRA] intend the debate on any resolution of disapproval to focus on the law that authorized the rule and make the congressional intent clear regarding the agency's options or lack thereof after enactment of a joint resolution of disapproval. It will be the agency's responsibility in the first instance when promulgating the rule to determine the range of discretion afforded under the original law and whether the law authorizes the agency to issue a substantially different rule. Then, the agency must give effect to the resolution of disapproval.</FP>
                    <P>
                        129. Accordingly, the Commission observes that, in the floor debate on the resolution of disapproval in 2017, supporters of the resolution did not mention the breach notification provision apart from a brief reference. Senators who spoke in favor of the resolution cited the 
                        <E T="03">2016 Privacy Order'</E>
                        s treatment of broadband providers and the information they hold as different from providers of other services on the internet. The debate gives no reason to believe that the breach notification rule motivated those members of Congress who supported the resolution. Although the Commission's conclusion that the whole 
                        <E T="03">2016 Privacy Order</E>
                         is the relevant “rule” for purposes of 5 U.S.C. 801(b)(2) is fully justified even without considering the legislative history of the resolution of disapproval, the Commission rejects arguments that it is inappropriate to also look at that history and contentions that the Commission is misinterpreting that history. In addition to legislative history of the CRA that indicates that the legislative history of each resolution of disapproval should be relevant, out of an abundance of caution given the lack of an authoritative determination specifying the details of how to evaluate whether a rule is substantially the same under 5 U.S.C. 801(b)(2), the Commission considers whether there are indicia from the legislative history of the resolution of disapproval here to inform that analysis. For instance, if the legislative history indicated that the resolution of disapproval of the 
                        <E T="03">2016 Privacy Order</E>
                         somehow hinged entirely or significantly on concern about some or all of the 2016 data breach reporting requirements, the Commission then could consider whether and how to account for that in the 5 U.S.C. 801(b)(2) analysis notwithstanding the fact that there is little practical overlap between this order and the entirety of the 
                        <E T="03">2016 Privacy Order.</E>
                         Although data breach notification issues occasionally appear to have been raised by opponents of the resolution of disapproval, high-level statements by supporters of the resolution about “FCC overreach” or the like do not, without more, persuade the Commission that the 2016 data breach notification requirements played a 
                        <PRTPAGE P="9995"/>
                        significant role in motivating the resolution of disapproval. Thus, the Commission sees nothing in the legislative history of the resolution of disapproval that would cause the Commission to question its conclusion that its action here does not adopt substantially the same rule for CRA purposes.

                        <E T="03">2016 Privacy Order</E>
                         under the CRA was largely predicated on claims that the Order would create duplicative privacy authority with the Federal Trade Commission as relates to broadband internet service providers. A review of the Congressional record from 2017 reveals that this indeed appears to have been the animating justification for Congressional disapproval of the 
                        <E T="03">2016 Privacy Order.</E>
                         Whatever the merits of such an argument, the Commission finds that it does not now preclude the Commission from adopting the rules set forth in this Order. As EPIC notes, the rules the Commission adopts here are not privacy measures directed at broadband internet service providers, but rather, data security measures directed at providers of telecommunications, interconnected VoIP services, and TRS, and which build upon rules that have existed since 2007. Thus, the primary animating justification behind Congressional disapproval of the 
                        <E T="03">2016 Privacy Order</E>
                         is irrelevant to the present case.

                        131. In addition, the revisions that the Commission makes here to the breach notification rule are different in substantial ways from those that Congress disapproved in 2017. The 
                        <E T="03">2016 Privacy Order</E>
                         was focused in large part on adopting privacy rules for broadband internet access service, and also made a number of changes to the Commission's privacy rules more generally that, among other things, required carriers to disclose their privacy practices, revised the framework for customer choice regarding carriers' access, use, and disclosure of the customers' information, and imposed data security requirements in addition to data breach notification requirements. When the 
                        <E T="03">2016 Privacy Order</E>
                         is viewed as a whole, it is clear that there is at most a small conceptual overlap between the adoption of data breach notification requirements at issue here and the many actions taken in that 
                        <E T="03">Order</E>
                         of which data breach notification requirements represented only a small fraction.

                    <P>
                        132. Independently, even assuming 
                        <E T="03">arguendo</E>
                         that the CRA were interpreted to require an evaluation on a more granular basis here, the Commission is not persuaded that the requirements it adopts here are substantially the same as analogous requirements in the 
                        <E T="03">2016 Privacy Order.</E>
                         For example, the customer notification requirement the Commission adopts here is materially less prescriptive regarding the content and manner of customer notice than what the Commission adopted in 2016. Further, the 2016 data breach notification rules for customer notifications and government agency notifications did not incorporate the good-faith exception from the definition of covered breaches that the Commission adopts here. With respect to the Federal agency notification requirements, as compared to the 2016 rules, the rules the Commission adopts here in that regard provide for the Commission and other law enforcement agencies to gain a much more complete picture of data breaches, including trends and emerging activities, consistent with the demonstrated need for such oversight. Consequently, even assuming 
                        <E T="03">arguendo</E>
                         that one were to conduct the 5 U.S.C. 801(b)(2) evaluation on a more granular basis, the Commission is not persuaded that the data breach notification requirements the Commission adopts here would be substantially the same as breach notification requirements adopted in the 
                        <E T="03">2016 Privacy Order.</E>
                         Even assuming one were to conduct the 5 U.S.C. 801(b)(2) evaluation at a more granular basis, the Commission is not persuaded that the breach notification rule from the 
                        <E T="03">2016 Privacy Order</E>
                         is the right level of granularity, nor that the evaluation of whether rules are substantially the same should be conducted based on high-level policy similarities, as some commenters contend. For example, the customer notification requirement is itself a “rule” within the meaning of the APA, as is the Federal agency notification requirement. Ultimately, however viewed, the Commission is persuaded that the rules it adopts here are not substantially the same as a disapproved rule for purposes of the CRA.
                    </P>
                    <P>
                        133. Nor is the Commission adopting something substantially the same as the 
                        <E T="03">2016 Privacy Order</E>
                         as a whole through the aggregate effect of individual Commission actions. For one, the theory that classification of broadband internet access service as a telecommunications service will automatically subject those services to the Commission's privacy rules, including the data breach notification requirements adopted here, is belied by multiple considerations: (1) the Commission has simply sought comment on those classification issues in its 
                        <E T="03">Open internet Notice</E>
                         and has not yet acted in that regard; (2) the 
                        <E T="03">2015 Open internet Order</E>
                         shows that the Commission is willing and able to decline to apply rules that might be triggered by a classification decision, having done so there, for example, by forbearing from all rules implementing section 222 pending consideration in a subsequent proceeding; and (3) the 
                        <E T="03">Open internet Notice</E>
                         sought comment on following the same approach to privacy that the Commission took in the 
                        <E T="03">2015 Open internet Order</E>
                         and specifically noted the resolution of disapproval of the 
                        <E T="03">2016 Privacy Order</E>
                         as a relevant consideration bearing on how it proceeds there. The Commission's analysis also is not materially altered by arguments that the Commission otherwise has adopted “data security, customer authentication, employee training, and other requirements.” In addition to being unpersuaded that such requirements substantially “mirror provisions of the 2016 order,” the Commission independently is not persuaded that the aggregation of such requirements and the data breach notification requirements adopted here lead to such a significant overlap with the 
                        <E T="03">2016 Privacy Order</E>
                         as to render the Commission's collective actions substantially the same as the 
                        <E T="03">2016 Privacy Order</E>
                         as a whole. For example, in the recent 
                        <E T="03">SIM Swap Order,</E>
                         the Commission adopted certain privacy requirements focused on wireless carriers' practices in the specific context of account transfers (or “swaps”) from a device associated with one subscriber identity module (SIM) to a device associated with a different SIM on in connection with a wireless number being ported out. That is a vastly different focus than the 
                        <E T="03">2016 Privacy Order,</E>
                         which focused on the general privacy practices of all carriers. Thus, even assuming 
                        <E T="03">arguendo</E>
                         some high-level conceptual similarities, the operation and practical effect is significantly different than even arguably analogous requirements that were part of the 
                        <E T="03">2016 Privacy Order.</E>
                         As discussed above, the primary focus of the 
                        <E T="03">2016 Privacy Order</E>
                         was privacy rules for broadband internet access service, along with a number of changes to the Commission's privacy rules more generally that, among other things, required carriers to disclose their privacy practices, and revised the framework for customer choice regarding carriers' access, use, and disclosure of the customers' information. Given the other significant issues central to that decision, even assuming 
                        <E T="03">arguendo</E>
                         that there were some conceptual overlap between the 
                        <PRTPAGE P="9996"/>
                        issues addressed in the 
                        <E T="03">2016 Privacy Order</E>
                         and data security, customer authentication, and employee training requirements recently adopted by the Commission—and even considered in conjunction with the data breach notification rules the Commission adopts here—the Commission is not persuaded that the Commission has adopted substantially the same rule as the 
                        <E T="03">2016 Privacy Order.</E>
                         Separately, insofar as the Commission considers the legislative history of the 2017 resolution of disapproval, data security, customer authentication, and employee training requirements likewise received only isolated mention, and then primarily with respect to broadband internet access service. Consequently, that legislative history does not reveal that the resolution of disapproval hinged entirely or significantly on concerns about such issues, even considered collectively. Thus, whether viewed alone or in the aggregate, the Commission is not persuaded that it has adopted substantially the same rule as the 
                        <E T="03">2016 Privacy Order</E>
                         as a whole. And the Commission notes, of course, that Congressional disapproval of a particular rule implementing a statute does not nullify an agency's general authority under that statute.

                    <P>
                        2. The 
                        <E T="03">Report and Order</E>
                         takes several important steps aimed at updating the Commission's rules regarding data breach notifications, both to Federal agencies and to customers, to better protect consumers from the dangers associated with data security breaches of customer information and to ensure that the Commission's rules keep pace with modern challenges.  
                    </P>
                    <P>3. First, the Commission expands the scope of the data breach notification rules to cover various categories of personally identifiable information (PII) that carriers hold with respect to their customers. Second, the Commission expands the definition of “breach” for telecommunications carriers to include inadvertent access, use, or disclosure of customer information, except in those cases where such information is acquired in good faith by an employee or agent of a carrier, and such information is not used improperly or futher disclosed. Third, the Commission requires carriers to notify the Commission, in addition to the United States Secret Service (Secret Service) and Federal Bureau of Investigation (FBI), as soon as practicable, and in no event later than seven business days after reasonable determination of a breach. Fourth, the Commission eliminates the requirement that carriers notify customers of a breach in cases where a carrier can reasonably determine that no harm to customers is reasonably likely to occur as a result of the breach, or where a breach solely involves encrypted data and the carrier has definitive evidence that the encryption key was not also accessed, used, or disclosed. Fifth, the Commission eliminates the mandatory waiting period for carriers to notify customers, and instead requires carriers to notify customers of breaches of covered data without unreasonable delay after notification to Federal agencies, and in no case more than 30 days following reasonable determination of a breach, unless a delay is requested by law enforcement. Sixth, and finally, to ensure that telecommunications relay service (TRS) customers enjoy the same level of protections as customers of telecommunications carriers, the Commission adopts equivalent requirements for TRS providers. By adopting these requirements the Commission increases the the protection of consumers from improper use and/or disclosure of their information consistent with approaches to protect the public adopted by the Commission's Federal and State government partners.</P>

                        4. There were no comments raised that specifically addressed the proposed rules and policies presented in the IRFA. Nonetheless, the Commission considered the general comments received about the potential impact of the rules proposed in the IRFA on small entities and took steps where appropriate and feasible, as discussed below, to reduce the compliance burden and the economic impact of the rules adopted in the

Pursuant to the Small Business Jobs Act of 2010, which amended the RFA, the Commission is required to respond to any comments filed by the Chief Counsel for Advocacy of the Small Business Administration (SBA), and to provide a detailed statement of any change made to the proposed rules as a result of those comments. The Chief Counsel did not file any comments in response to the proposed rules in this proceeding.</P>

                    <P>6. The RFA directs agencies to provide a description of, and where feasible, an estimate of the number of small entities that may be affected by the rules adopted herein. The RFA generally defines the term “small entity” as having the same meaning as the terms “small business,” “small organization,” and “small governmental jurisdiction.” In addition, the term “small business” has the same meaning as the term “small-business concern” under the Small Business Act. A “small-business concern” is one which: (1) is independently owned and operated; (2) is not dominant in its field of operation; and (3) satisfies any additional criteria established by the SBA.</P>

                        <E T="03">Small Businesses, Small Organizations, Small Governmental Jurisdictions.</E>
                         The Commission's actions, over time, may affect small entities that are not easily categorized at present. The Commission therefore describes, at 
                        <PRTPAGE P="9997"/>
                        the outset, three broad groups of small entities that could be directly affected herein. First, while there are industry specific size standards for small businesses that are used in the regulatory flexibility analysis, according to data from the Small Business Administration's (SBA) Office of Advocacy, in general a small business is an independent business having fewer than 500 employees. These types of small businesses represent 99.9% of all businesses in the United States, which translates to 32.5 million businesses.
                    </P>
                    <P>8. Next, the type of small entity described as a “small organization” is generally “any not-for-profit enterprise which is independently owned and operated and is not dominant in its field.” The Internal Revenue Service (IRS) uses a revenue benchmark of $50,000 or less to delineate its annual electronic filing requirements for small exempt organizations. Nationwide, for tax year 2020, there were approximately 447,689 small exempt organizations in the U.S. reporting revenues of $50,000 or less according to the registration and tax data for exempt organizations available from the IRS.</P>
                    <P>9. Finally, the small entity described as a “small governmental jurisdiction” is defined generally as “governments of cities, counties, towns, townships, villages, school districts, or special districts, with a population of less than fifty thousand.” U.S. Census Bureau data from the 2017 Census of Governments indicate there were 90,075 local governmental jurisdictions consisting of general purpose governments and special purpose governments in the United States. Of this number there were 36,931 general purpose governments (county, municipal and town or township) with populations of less than 50,000 and 12,040 special purpose governments—independent school districts with enrollment populations of less than 50,000. Accordingly, based on the 2017 U.S. Census of Governments data, the Commission estimates that at least 48,971 entities fall into the category of “small governmental jurisdictions.”</P>

                         The U.S. Census Bureau defines this industry as establishments primarily engaged in operating and/or providing access to transmission facilities and infrastructure that they own and/or lease for the transmission of voice, data, text, sound, and video using wired communications networks. Transmission facilities may be based on a single technology or a combination of technologies. Establishments in this industry use the wired telecommunications network facilities that they operate to provide a variety of services, such as wired telephony services, including VoIP services, wired (cable) audio and video programming distribution, and wired broadband internet services. By exception, establishments providing satellite television distribution services using facilities and infrastructure that they operate are included in this industry. Wired Telecommunications Carriers are also referred to as wireline carriers or fixed local service providers.

Additionally, based on Commission data in the 2022 Universal Service Monitoring Report, as of December 31, 2021, there were 4,590 providers that reported they were engaged in the provision of fixed local services.

                         The Communications Act of 1934, as amended, contains a size standard for a “small cable operator,” which is “a cable operator that, directly or through an affiliate, serves in the aggregate fewer than one percent of all subscribers in the United States and is not affiliated with any entity or entities whose gross annual revenues in the aggregate exceed $250,000,000.” For purposes of the Telecom Act Standard, the Commission determined that a cable system operator that serves fewer than 498,000 subscribers, either directly or through affiliates, will meet the definition of a small cable operator. Based on industry data, only six cable system operators have more than 498,000 subscribers. Accordingly, the Commission estimates that the majority of cable system operators are small under this size standard. The Commission notes however, that the Commission neither requests nor collects information on whether cable system operators are affiliated with entities whose gross annual revenues exceed $250 million. Therefore, the Commission is unable at this time to estimate with greater precision the number of cable system operators that would qualify as small cable operators under the definition in the Communications Act.

                         the Commission expanded the scope of the Commission's breach notification rules to cover various categories of customer PII held by telecommunications carriers. The Commission also adopted a requirement that all telecommunications carriers notify the Commission, in addition to the Secret Service and the FBI, as soon as practicable, and in no event later than seven business days after reasonable determination of a breach of covered data. The Commission exempted from this notification requirement breaches that affect fewer than 500 customers and for which the carrier reasonably determines that no harm to customers is reasonably likely to occur as a result of the breach. Instead, the Commission required carriers to sign and file with the Commission and other law enforcement an annual summary regarding all such breaches occurring in the previous calendar year. Carriers must also notify affected customers of breaches, with the exception of instances where a carrier can reasonably determine that no harm to such customers is reasonably likely to occur as a result of the breach. Additionally, the Commission applied similar rules to TRS providers.

                    <P>
                        25. The Commission's review of the record included comments about unique burdens for small businesses that may be impacted by the notification requirements adopted in the 
                        <E T="03">Report and Order.</E>
                         Accordingly, the Commission considered, and adopted provisions to mitigate, some of those concerns. For example, the Commission decided to utilize the existing reporting portal, which small and other carriers and TRS providers are already accustomed to using to notify the Commission along with the Secret Service and FBI of breaches rather than creating a centralized reporting facility operated by the Commission to report breaches to the Commission and these agencies as proposed in the 
                        <E T="03">Data Breach Notice.</E>
                         As such, the Commission anticipates that the requirement to notify it of data breaches will have de minimis cost implications because small and other carriers and TRS providers are already obligated to notify the Secret Service and FBI of such breaches, and will use the existing portal to do so. The Commission delegated authority to the Wireline Competition Bureau to coordinate with the Secret Service, the current administrator of the reporting facility, and the FBI, to the extent necessary, to ensure that the Commission will be notified when data breaches are reported, thereby ensuring that no additional burden would be imposed on small and other carriers and TRS providers. The Commission also adopted a threshold trigger that permits carriers and TRS providers to forgo notifying Federal agencies of breaches that are limited in scope and unlikely to pose harm to customers, instead requiring small and other carriers and TRS providers to maintain the information, and file an annual summary of such breaches. Additionally, with the support of several small carriers, the Commission adopted a harm-based notification trigger for reporting breaches to customers, which allows small and rural providers to focus their resources on data security and mitigation measures rather than generating notifications where harm to the consumer is unlikely.

                         the Commission also adopted a “without unreasonable delay, but no later than 30 days after reasonable determination of the breach” timeframe for notifying customers of covered data breaches. Consistent with the comments in support of small carriers interests, the Commission recognizes that this reporting standard can take into account factors such as the provider's size, as a small carrier may have limited resources and could require additional time to investigate a data breach than a large carrier. The Commission notes that many State laws similarly require breach notifications which are in line with the requirements that the Commission adopts today. Therefore, although the Commission cannot quantify the compliance costs, it does not expect the adopted rules to impose any significant cost burdens for small entities, or require these entities to hire professionals to meet their compliance obligations.

                        28. The Commission took steps and considered alternatives in this proceeding that may reduce the impact of the adopted rule changes on small entities. For example, the Commission's expansion of the definition of “breach” included consideration of whether to include situations where a telecommunications carrier, or a third party discovers conduct that could have reasonably led to exposure of customer CPNI, even if it has not yet determined if such exposure occurred. Small and other commenters generally opposed such an expansion, and the Commission ultimately declined to expand “breach” to include these situations. Conversely, although some commenters on behalf of small entities opposed requiring breach notification to the Commission, the Commission was not persuaded by their arguments. The Commission disagreed that the existing requirement to notify the Secret Service and the FBI is sufficient and that adding the Commission to the list of recipients of the same breach notifications Commission rules already require carriers to submit would impose any additional burden on carriers. Several actions the Commission takes in the 
                        <E T="03">Report and Order</E>
                         will avoid imposing additional burdens on small and other carriers who have to file breach notifications with the Commission.

                    <P>
                        29. As an initial matter the Commission considered, and included a good-faith exception that excluded from the definition of “breach” a good-faith acquisition of covered data by an employee or agent of a carrier where such information is not used improperly or further disclosed. The Commission believes this exception will help avoid excessive notifications to consumers, and reduce reporting burdens on small and other carriers. Furthermore, in the 
                        <E T="03">Data Breach Notice,</E>
                         the Commission proposed to create a new portal for reporting breaches to the Commission. However, in the 
                        <E T="03">Report and Order</E>
                         the Commission decided instead to make use of the existing portal which small and other carriers and TRS providers are already accustomed to using for data breach reporting requirements to Federal law enforcement agencies. The Commission's decision to continue using a portal that small and other carriers and providers are already familiar and comfortable working with reduces the administrative burdens on small entities of learning a new mechanism and creating new reporting processes. Additionally, the contents of the notification to the Commission are the same fields that carriers and providers already report to the Secret Service and the FBI. The Commission agreed with commenters on behalf of small entities that the breach notification information small and other carriers and providers are required to submit to the FBI and Secret Service is largely sufficient, and the Commission should generally require reporting of the same information. As such, the impact of also reporting the breach to the Commission should be de minimis on small carriers and providers. The Commission considered adopting a lower reporting threshold for the affected-customer notification of no-harm-risk breaches to the Federal agencies but ultimately decided to adopt a 500-customer threshold because that is consistent with many other State laws, and would therefore promote consistency and efficiency in compliance. A lower threshold could impose higher burdens on small and other carriers and providers, so the Commission declined to adopt such a rule. Likewise for consistency and efficiency, the Commission similarly declined to adopt a threshold of 5000 affected customers to trigger notification to Federal agencies. The Commission also considered ways to reduce the burden of the annual reporting requirement for breaches affecting fewer than 500 individuals and where the carrier or TRS provider could reasonably determine that no harm to customers was reasonably likely to occur as a result of the breach. In determining the content and format requirements of the annual report, the Commission instructed the Bureau to minimize the burdens on carriers and TRS providers by, for example, limiting the content required for each reported breach to that absolutely necessary to identify patterns or gaps that require further Commission inquiry. At a minimum, the Commission directed the Bureau to develop requirements that are less burdensome than what is required for individual breach submissions to the reporting facility, and to consider streamlined ways for filers to report this summary information.

                    <P>
                        30. The Commission also considered adopting minimum requirements for the contents of customer notifications for telecommunications carriers and TRS providers. However, the Commission declined to impose such minimum requirements on carriers and TRS providers because doing so may create unnecessary burdens on carriers and TRS providers, particularly small ones. Specifically, the Commission considered but declined to adopt minimum reporting requirements harmonizing content requirements for carriers with the information required under the Cyber Incident Reporting for Critical Infrastructure Act of 2022 (CIRCIA) as part of their notifications to Federal agencies. In the absence of final rules, and a potential for imposing duplicative or inconsistent fields, by declining to adopt such a requirement the Commission minimizes the economic impact for small entities. Relatedly, the Commission declined to adopt a specific method of notification for customers, instead deciding that carriers and TRS providers have pre-established methods of reaching their customers, each carrier or TRS provider is in the best position to know how best to reach their customers, and imposing a specific method would add unnecessary burdens to the industry. The Commission also considered requiring notification to all customers whenever a breach occurred. Such a requirement would lead to increased obligations to notify customers of every instance which qualified as a “breach” 
                        <PRTPAGE P="10001"/>
                        under the expanded definition and scope of the rules described in the 
                        <E T="03">Report and Order.</E>
                         However, by adopting the harm-based trigger, the Commission limits the applicability of the customer-notification obligations to breaches which are likely to cause harm to customers, thereby reducing burdens on small and other telecommunications carriers and TRS providers. In addition, the Commission also adopted a safe harbor under which customer notification is not required where a breach solely involves encrypted data and the carrier has definitive evidence that the encryption key was not also accessed, used, or disclosed, further reducing burdens on small and other carriers from the Commission's customer notification requirements.

                        31. The Commission's actions and the considerations discussed above lead the Commission to believe that the new requirements adopted in the

                         are minimally burdensome, and small carriers and TRS providers should not have any increased regulatory burdens, or significant compliance issues with including these new breach notification requirements in their existing processes. Nevertheless, the importance of the breach notification requirements adopted in the

                         Pursuant to the Regulatory Flexibility Act of 1980 (RFA), as amended, the Commission's Final Regulatory Flexibility Analysis is set forth in Appendix B. The Commission's Consumer and Governmental Affairs Bureau, Reference Information Center, will send a copy of this Report and Order, including the FRFA, to the Chief Counsel for Advocacy of the Small Business Administration (SBA).

                         This document contains new or modified information collection requirements subject to the Paperwork Reduction Act of 1995 (PRA), Public Law 104–13. All such new or modified requirements will be submitted to OMB for review under section 3507(d) of the PRA. OMB, the general public, and other Federal agencies will be invited to comment on any new or modified information collection requirements contained in this proceeding. In addition, the Commission notes that pursuant to the Small Business Paperwork Relief Act of 2002, Public Law 107–198, 
                        <E T="03">see</E>
                         47 U.S.C. 3506(c)(4), the Commission previously sought specific comment on how the Commission might further reduce the information collection burden for small business concerns with fewer than 25 employees.
                    </P>
                    <P>35. In this Report and Order, the Commission has assessed the effects of (1) expanding the scope of the data breach notification rules to cover specific categories of PII that carriers hold with respect to their customers; (2) expanding the definition of “breach” to include inadvertent access, use, or disclosure of customer information, except in those cases where such information is acquired in good faith by an employee or agent of a carrier, and such information is not used improperly or further disclosed; (3) requiring carriers to notify the Commission, in addition to Secret Service and FBI, as soon as practicable, and in no event later than seven business days after reasonable determination of a breach; (4) eliminating the requirement that carriers notify customers of a breach in cases where a carrier can reasonably determine that no harm to customers is reasonably likely to occur as a result of the breach, or where the breach solely involved encrypted data and the carrier had definitive evidence that the encryption key was not also accessed, used, or disclosed; and (5) applying similar rules to TRS providers, and the Commission finds that the impact on small businesses with fewer than 25 employees will be minimal. While the Commission expanded the scope of the data breach notification rules, the Commission also adopted a good-faith exception from the definition of breach which limits the reportable instances. Additionally, the Commission decided to utilize the existing reporting portal, which small carriers and TRS providers are already accustomed to using, for Federal agency breach notifications rather than creating a new centralized portal. The Commission delegated authority to the Wireline Competition Bureau to coordinate with the Secret Service, the current administrator of the reporting facility, and the FBI, to the extent necessary, to ensure that the Commission will be notified when data breaches are reported, thereby ensuring that no additional burden would be imposed on small and other carriers and TRS providers from separate reporting requirements. The Commission also exempted from the Federal agency reporting requirement breaches that affect fewer than 500 customers and for which the carrier reasonably determines that no harm to customers is reasonably likely to occur, and instead require carriers to file with Federal agencies an annual summary regarding all such breaches occurring in the previous calendar year. This annual reporting requirement is intended to minimize the burden of reporting such breaches to Federal law enforcement and the Commission. In determining the content and format requirements of the annual report, the Commission instructed the Bureau to minimize the burdens on carriers and TRS providers by, for example, limiting the content required for each reported breach to that absolutely necessary to identify patterns or gaps that require further Commission inquiry. Additionally, with the support of several small carriers, the Commission adopted a harm-based notification trigger for reporting breaches to customers, which allows small providers to focus their resources on data security and mitigation measures rather than generating notifications where harm to the consumer is unlikely.</P>

                         The Commission has determined, and the Administrator of the Office of Information and Regulatory Affairs, Office of Management and Budget, concurs, that this rule is non-major under the Congressional Review Act, 5 U.S.C. 804(2). The Commission will send a copy of this Report and Order to Congress and the Government Accountability Office pursuant to 5 U.S.C. 801(a)(1)(A).

                         The OPEN Government Data Act, requires agencies to make “public data assets” available under an open license and as “open Government data assets,”

                        based on an open standard that is maintained by a standards organization. This requirement is to be implemented “in accordance with guidance by the Director” of the OMB. The term “public data asset” means “a data asset, or part thereof, maintained by the Federal Government that has been, or may be, released to the public, including any data asset, or part thereof, subject to disclosure under [the Freedom of Information Act (FOIA)].” A “data asset” is “a collection of data elements or data sets that may be grouped together,” and “data” is “recorded information, regardless of form or the media on which the data is recorded.” The Commission delegates authority, including the authority to adopt rules, to the Wireline Competition Bureau, in consultation with the agency's Chief Data Officer and after seeking public comment to the extent it deems appropriate, to determine whether to make publicly available any data assets maintained or created by the Commission pursuant to the rules adopted herein, and if so, to determine when and to what extent such information should be made publicly available. In doing so, the Bureau shall take into account the extent to which such data assets should not be made publicly available because they are not subject to disclosure under the FOIA.

                                 Except as provided in paragraph (a)(3) of this section, as soon as practicable, but no later than seven business days, after reasonable determination of a breach, a telecommunications carrier shall electronically notify the Commission, the United States Secret Service (Secret Service), and the Federal Bureau of Investigation (FBI) through a central reporting facility. The Commission will maintain a link to the reporting facility on its website.

Such period may be extended by the agency as reasonably necessary in the judgment of the agency. If such direction is given, the agency shall notify the carrier when it appears that public disclosure or notice to affected customers will no longer impede or compromise a criminal investigation or national security. The agency shall provide in writing its initial direction to the carrier, any subsequent extension, and any notification that notice will no longer impede or compromise a criminal investigation or national security.</P>

                                carrier reasonably determines that no harm to customers is reasonably likely to occur as a result of the breach. In circumstances where a carrier initially determined that it qualified for an exemption under this paragraph (a)(3), but later discovers information such that this exemption no longer applies, the carrier must report the breach to Federal agencies as soon as practicable, but no later than within seven business days of this discovery, as required in this paragraph (a).

This notification shall include sufficient information so as to make a reasonable customer aware that a breach occurred on a certain date, or within a certain estimated timeframe, and that such a breach affected or may have affected that customer's data. Notwithstanding the foregoing, customer notification shall not be required where a carrier reasonably determines that no harm to customers is reasonably likely to occur as a result of the breach, or where the breach solely involves encrypted data and the carrier has definitive evidence that the encryption key was not also accessed, used, or disclosed.

The record shall include, if available, dates of discovery and notification, a detailed description of the covered data that was the subject of the breach, the circumstances of the breach, and the bases of any determinations regarding the number of affected customers or likelihood of harm as a result of the breach. Carriers shall retain the record for a minimum of 2 years.

                                 A telecommunications carrier shall have an officer, as an agent of the carrier, sign and file with the Commission, Secret Service, and FBI, a summary of all breaches occurring in the previous calendar year affecting fewer than 500 individuals and where the carrier could reasonably determine that no harm to customers was reasonably likely to occur as a result of the breach. This filing shall be made annually, on or before February 1 of each year, through the central reporting facility, for data pertaining to the previous calendar year.

                                 (1) As used in this section, a “breach” occurs when a person, without authorization or exceeding authorization, gains access to, uses, or discloses covered data. A “breach” shall not include a good-faith acquisition of covered data by an employee or agent of a telecommunications carrier where such information is not used improperly or further disclosed.

The Commission will maintain a link to the reporting facility on its website.

Such period may be extended by the agency as reasonably necessary in the judgment of the agency. If such direction is given, the agency shall notify the TRS provider when it appears that public disclosure or notice to affected customers will no longer

                            <P>(3) A TRS provider is exempt from the requirement to provide notification to the Commission and law enforcement pursuant to paragraph (a) of this section of a breach that affects fewer than 500 customers and the carrier reasonably determines that no harm to customers is reasonably likely to occur as a result of the breach. In circumstances where a carrier initially determined that it qualified for an exemption under this paragraph (a)(3), but later discovers information such that this exemption no longer applies, the carrier must report the breach to Federal agencies as soon as practicable, but not later than within seven business days of this discovery, as required in this paragraph (a).</P>

                                 Except as provided in paragraph (a)(2) of this section, a TRS provider shall notify affected customers of breaches of covered data without unreasonable delay after notification to the Commission and law enforcement as described in paragraph (a) of this section, and no later than 30 days after reasonable determination of a breach. This notification shall include sufficient information so as to make a reasonable customer aware that a breach occurred on a certain date, or within a certain estimated timeframe, and that such a breach affected or may have affected that customer's data. Notwithstanding the foregoing, customer notification shall not be required where a TRS provider reasonably determines that no harm to customers is reasonably likely to occur as a result of the breach, or where the breach solely involves encrypted data and the provider has definitive evidence that the encryption key was not also accessed, used, or disclosed.

                                 A TRS provider shall maintain a record, electronically or in some other manner, of any breaches discovered, notifications made to the Commission, Secret Service, and the FBI pursuant to paragraph (a) of this section, and notifications made to customers pursuant to paragraph (b) of this section. The record shall include, if available, the dates of discovery and notification, a detailed description of the covered data that was the subject of the breach, the circumstances of the breach, and the bases of any determinations regarding the number of affected customers or likelihood of harm as a result of the breach. TRS providers shall retain the record for a minimum of 2 years.

                                 A TRS provider shall have an officer, as an agent of the provider, sign and file with the Commission, Secret Service, and FBI, a summary of all breaches occurring in the previous calendar year affecting fewer than 500 individuals and where the provider could reasonably determine that no harm to customers was reasonably likely to occur as a result of the breach. This filing shall be made annually, on or before February 1 of each year, through the central reporting facility, for data pertaining to the previous calendar year.
